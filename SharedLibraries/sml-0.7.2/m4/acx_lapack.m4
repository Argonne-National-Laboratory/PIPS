# SYNOPSIS
#
#   ACX_LAPACK([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro looks for a library that implements the LAPACK linear-algebra
#   interface (see http://www.netlib.org/lapack/). On success, it sets the
#   LAPACK_LIBS output variable to hold the requisite library linkages.
#
#   To link with LAPACK, you should link with:
#
#       $LAPACK_LIBS $BLAS_LIBS $LIBS $FLIBS
#
#   in that order. BLAS_LIBS is the output variable of the ACX_BLAS macro,
#   called automatically. FLIBS is the output variable of the
#   AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS macro (called if necessary by ACX_BLAS), and is
#   sometimes necessary in order to link with F77 libraries. Users will also
#   need to use AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN (see the autoconf manual), for the same
#   reason.
#
#   The user may also use --with-lapack=<lib> in order to use some specific
#   LAPACK library <lib>. In order to link successfully, however, be aware
#   that you will probably need to use the same Fortran compiler (which can
#   be set via the F77 env. var.) as was used to compile the LAPACK and BLAS
#   libraries.
#
#   ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a LAPACK library
#   is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
#   is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
#   will define HAVE_LAPACK.
