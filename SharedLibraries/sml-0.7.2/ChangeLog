  * Version 0.7.2

2011-01-28  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Introduced the PrintLevelValues enum to control the amount of printing 
    required.

2011-01-27  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Fixed a bug in StochModelComp::transcribeToModelComp() that didn't apply
    the probability terms to the objective function of a stochastic model
    unless it was formulated with Exp(). By design, objectives given within 
    stochastic models are to be interpreted as expectation, so we apply the
    probability terms to such objectives. This corrects the alm, alm_xi and
    newsvendor models, which before this fix needed Exp() in the objective to
    produce the correct solution. We now report an error if Exp() is used
    explicitly inside an objective.

2011-01-24  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Changed the NlFile class to store the pointer to the ASL_pfgh structure so
    that the content of the *.nl file can be read only once (by readNlFile()
    called from the constructor) and cached.
  * Added a pointer to the ASL structure so that the reading of the *.nl file
    through f_read() can be cached.

2011-01-21  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Removed the calls to write_columnfile_for_submodel() that generated the
    .acl files since they were not used.

2011-01-20  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Improved the readability of the generated ampl models.
  * Fixed a bug for which the expressions in the Exp() where not properly
    parenthesised, which caused the probability to multiply only the first
    term instead of the whole expression.

2011-01-17  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Fixed a bug in ExpandedModel::setLocalVarInfo() that caused a repeated
    entry to appear in the solution file if the name of a variable was a
    proper substring of another one (such as 'slack' and 'slackTotal' in
    test-01.mod).

2011-01-11  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Introduced a virtual interface to be implemented by the StochModel and
    StochModelComp classes. This allows to remove a number of dynamic_casts
    to the derived classes.

2011-01-02  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Moved some members of the StochModelComp class in the private section
    and added accessors.

2010-12-28  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Simplified the implementation of ListNode, now it reuses most methods
    directly from SyntaxNode.

2010-12-27  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Reimplemented SyntaxNode::findIDREF(list<SyntaxNode*> *lnd) by calling
    findOpCode().
  * Added SyntaxNode::front()/back() to provide direct access to the first/last
    child.
  * Used a vector<SyntaxNode*> to store the children of a SyntaxNode. This
    allows the reuse of the STL vector::iterator.

2010-12-22  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Declared more methods as const.

2010-12-21  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Cleaned up the included headers, reducing the header dependencies by
    forward-declaring the classes when possible.

2009-12-28  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Made the member variables of the IDNode class private, and added the
    corresponding getters and setters.
  * Added AM_SILENT_RULES to produce a less verbose output from the makefiles,
    which works from automake 1.11; for older versions the output is unchanged.

2009-12-23  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Changed the IDNode class not to inherit from ValueNodeBase.
  * Fixed warnings in the interface wrappers and made the help output more
    consistent.

2009-12-22  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Fixed a possible use of initialised value in createTmpDirIfNotPresent().
  * Changed l_addIndex to store lists and structures directly rather than
    pointers, to avoid memory leaks.

2009-12-21  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Rewritten crush() in a way that doesn't use strtok_r(), which doesn't exist
    on MinGW.

2009-12-17  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Cleaned up createTmpDirIfNotPresent() and surrounding code.
  * Made process_model() return an error code instead of calling exit().
  * Defined a destructor for the ModelComp class.
  * Changed the return type of ModelComp::getGlobalName[New](),
    SyntaxNode::getValue() and SetElement::toCharA() to string to remove some
    leaks caused by the use of strdup().
  * Fix a major leak by adding a destructor to the ExpandedModel class.

2009-12-11  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Added check for the presence of the asl_pfgh.h header for amplsolver.

2009-12-10  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Removed the hardcoded -ldl from the makefiles, which used to break building
    under MinGW. This is replaced by a check for the presence of this library
    in acx_ampl.m4.
  * Converted the oops interface to the C++ version of the library.
  * Updated the user guide.

2009-12-07  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Added the acx_cplex.m4 macro to configure the Cplex interface.

2009-11-30  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Added the newsvendor test example.
  * Improved the compilation under MinGW by adding appropriate header and
    function checks in the configure step.

2009-11-22  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Added a basic ALM test example.
  * Fixes and reformatting to the alm_xi test example.
  * Check for the existence of the data file before passing it to AMPL.
  * Switch off the call to parse_data() since at the moment we use AMPL to
    process the data file, and these calls only contribute to quite large
    memory leaks.

2009-11-21  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Compilation fixes for gcc 4.4.
  * Fixed some portability problems to allow the compilation under MinGW
    (which is still not automated and requires manual fiddling).

2009-10-01  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Added the Cplex interface to SML.
  * Added destructors for the NlFile and IndexListValue classes.
  * Changed analyseOptions() in the mps and oops interfaces to return a failure
    code rather than calling exit().

2009-08-17  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Uniform the allocations of SyntaxNode objects to use new.
  * Updates, reformatting and small corrections to the doxygen documentation.

2009-08-14  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Fixed several memory leaks, including the largest one.

2009-08-12  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Version 0.7.1

2009-08-11  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>
  * Improved the way the solution is printed.

2009-08-11  Jonathan Hogg  <J.Hogg@ed.ac.uk>

  * Fixed amplsolver.a/libamplsolver.a issue when configured with --with-ampl
  * Propagate symbol table to stochastic models (needs done properly later)
  * Add routines to return list of symbols that are objectives
  * When reading row file skip dummy, objective and empty lines
  * Remove output processing that used to to the above
  * Fix unitialised parent value in ExpandedModelInterface

2009-08-08  Jonathan Hogg  <J.Hogg@ed.ac.uk>

  * Fix VPATH build by using $srcdir and fixing acx_oops.m4 to use absolute
  src path.
  * Remove -g -gstabs from build commands to improve portability. Use
  CXXFLAGS=-g at configure time from now on for debugging.
  * Modify README and userguide.tex to reflect that liboops.a is for 32-bit
  linux only.
  * Fix some spelling mistakes in various COPYING files

2009-08-07  Jonathan Hogg  <J.Hogg@ed.ac.uk>

  * Fix a bug that tried to output information for objFunc as a constraint

2009-03-24  Marco Colombo  <m.colombo@ed.ac.uk>

  * Version 0.7
  * First public release.

2009-03-11  Jonathan Hogg  <J.Hogg@ed.ac.uk>

  * Version 0.7-RC1
  * First release, works for example problems, but suffers from memory
  leaks. ChangeLog started to track changes, copyright notices added for
  LGPL release.
