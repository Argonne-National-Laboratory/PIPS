/** Class for consequent bounds.
    When a variable is branched on it normally interacts with other variables by
    means of equations.  There are cases where we want to step outside LP and do something
    more directly e.g. fix bounds.  This class is for that.

    A state of -9999 means at LB, +9999 means at UB,
    others mean if fixed to that value.
