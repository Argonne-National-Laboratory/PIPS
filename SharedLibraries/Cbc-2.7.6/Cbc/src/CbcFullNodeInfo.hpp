/** Information required to recreate the subproblem at this node

  When a subproblem is initially created, it is represented by a CbcNode
  object and an attached CbcNodeInfo object.

  The CbcNode contains information needed while the subproblem remains live.
  The CbcNode is deleted when the last branch arm has been evaluated.

  The CbcNodeInfo contains information required to maintain the branch-and-cut
  search tree structure (links and reference counts) and to recreate the
  subproblem for this node (basis, variable bounds, cutting planes). A
  CbcNodeInfo object remains in existence until all nodes have been pruned from
  the subtree rooted at this node.

  The principle used to maintain the reference count is that the reference
  count is always the sum of all potential and actual children of the node.
  Specifically,
  <ul>
    <li> Once it's determined how the node will branch, the reference count
	 is set to the number of potential children (<i>i.e.</i>, the number
	 of arms of the branch).
    <li> As each child is created by CbcNode::branch() (converting a potential
	 child to the active subproblem), the reference count is decremented.
    <li> If the child survives and will become a node in the search tree
	 (converting the active subproblem into an actual child), increment the
	 reference count.
  </ul>
  Notice that the active subproblem lives in a sort of limbo, neither a
  potential or an actual node in the branch-and-cut tree.

  CbcNodeInfo objects come in two flavours. A CbcFullNodeInfo object contains
  a full record of the information required to recreate a subproblem.
  A CbcPartialNodeInfo object expresses this information in terms of
  differences from the parent.

/** \brief Holds complete information for recreating a subproblem.

  A CbcFullNodeInfo object contains all necessary information (bounds, basis,
  and cuts) required to recreate a subproblem.

  \todo While there's no explicit statement, the code often makes the implicit
	assumption that an CbcFullNodeInfo structure will appear only at the
	root node of the search tree. Things will break if this assumption
	is violated.
