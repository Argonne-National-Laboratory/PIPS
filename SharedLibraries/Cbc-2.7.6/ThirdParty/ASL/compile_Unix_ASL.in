# Script to compile the Ampl Solver Library on Unix systems. Why this approach?
# Well, we don't want to get into the business of creating (and maintaining)
# the full set of autotools source files for the ASL. This approach tries to
# leverage makefile.u, which comes with ASL.

# To support VPATH builds, the strategy is to copy the sources to the build
# directory, build, and then erase the sources when we're done. Start by
# copying the sources.

# Remove the old compilation directory, if present, and create a new one. Then
# copy the sources. The wildcards given to ls will produce duplicates, which
# may result in a warning as the files are linked or copied.

# Adjust solvers/makefile.u for the system at hand. Really all we're doing
# is trying to automate the instructions in makefile.u. If you have build
# problems, a good thing to do is compare the shell code here with makefile.u,
# to see if it contains instructions that are not automated here. The final
# result is left in makefile.coin

# Allow make to decide the name of the archive program and the appropriate
# flags. makefile.u hardwires `ar' and sets ARFLAGS = ruv. Since we trash the
# entire build and start from scratch, the `u' in ruv stands for `useless'.

# System-specific tweaks.  On Solaris x86, we need to build fpsetprec.s
# (fpsetprec64.s for 64-bit builds). Add it to the dependency list for
# amplsolver.a. The 64-bit question here is how to reliably recognise a 64-bit
# build. For GCC, -m64 should do it. For Sun Studio, it's more difficult.
# Studio 12 and later recognises -m64. Earlier versions require
# -xarch=<something>, where something can be any of generic64, native64, amd64,
# or amd64a (and perhaps others). So ... let's go out on a limb and hope that
# -xarch=*64* will not pick up anything it shouldn't. Force leading and
# trailing spaces in the string we're matching, in case the 64-bit flag is the
# only content in CFLAGS.
