The files in this directory are intended to allow the compilation of
Fortran 77 source files by combining the Fortran to C translator f2c
(from netlib) and the Microsoft 'cl' C compiler under Cygwin and MSys.

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions how to use this tool.

After you installed this tool, you can use the script "compile_f2c" to
compile Fortran 77 code.  If you specify the flag
"--enable-doscompile=msvc" for the configure script in COIN projects,
it will automatically be used (unless a native Fortran compiler is
found).


The files in this directory are part of the BuildTools project of COIN-OR,
https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools.

The files are made available under the Eclipse Public License.
