  /** Generate probing/disaggregation cuts for the model of the 
      solver interface, si.

      This is a simplification of probing ideas put into OSL about
      ten years ago.  The only known documentation is a copy of a 
      talk handout - we think Robin Lougee-Heimer has a copy!

      For selected integer variables (e.g. unsatisfied ones) the effect of
      setting them up or down is investigated.  Setting a variable up
      may in turn set other variables (continuous as well as integer).
      There are various possible results:

      1) It is shown that problem is infeasible (this may also be
         because objective function or reduced costs show worse than
	 best solution).  If the other way is feasible we can generate
	 a column cut (and continue probing), if not feasible we can
	 say problem infeasible.

      2) If both ways are feasible, it can happen that x to 0 implies y to 1
         ** and x to 1 implies y to 1 (again a column cut).  More common
	 is that x to 0 implies y to 1 and x to 1 implies y to 0 so we could
	 substitute for y which might lead later to more powerful cuts.
	 ** This is not done in this code as there is no mechanism for
	 returning information.

      3) When x to 1 a constraint went slack by c.  We can tighten the
         constraint ax + .... <= b (where a may be zero) to
	 (a+c)x + .... <= b.  If this cut is violated then it is
	 generated.

      4) Similarly we can generate implied disaggregation cuts

      Note - differences to cuts in OSL.

      a) OSL had structures intended to make this faster.
      b) The "chaining" in 2) was done
      c) Row cuts modified original constraint rather than adding cut
      b) This code can cope with general integer variables.

      Insert the generated cuts into OsiCut, cs.

      If a "snapshot" of a matrix exists then this will be used.
      Presumably this will give global cuts and will be faster.
      No check is done to see if cuts will be global.

      Otherwise use current matrix.

      Both row cuts and column cuts may be returned

      The mode options are:
      0) Only unsatisfied integer variables will be looked at.
         If no information exists for that variable then
	 probing will be done so as a by-product you "may" get a fixing
	 or infeasibility.  This will be fast and is only available
         if a snapshot exists (otherwise as 1).  
	 The bounds in the snapshot are the ones used.
      1) Look at unsatisfied integer variables, using current bounds.
         Probing will be done on all looked at.
      2) Look at all integer variables, using current bounds.
         Probing will be done on all

	 row bounds and tightened coliumn bounds are generated
