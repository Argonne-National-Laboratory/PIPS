-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions are for linux-based systems (both 32-bit and 64-bit machines
are supported).

Requirements:
 - A recent version of Matlab
   (tested against 2008b, 2009a, 2009b, 2010a, 2010b, 2011a).
 - The supported C and Fortran compilers for your version of Matlab
   (g95 compiler for versions prior to 2011a, gfortran thereafter).
 - The MATLAB environment variable must point to your system matlab directory.
   From within Matlab, you can check where the environment variable points to
   by typing
       MATLAB
   If it is not pointing to the right location, then
   you can reset it by typing
       MATLAB = matlabpath
   where matlabpath is replaced by the path where Matlab is installed, for
   example,
       MATLAB = '/usr/local/matlab/'

-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Directory structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The directory matlab obtained after extracting the archive contains all the
codes necessary for the installation and use of the MATLAB interface for
HSL_MA86.

The files in the matlab directory are:

INSTALL                 Installation instructions
README                  Instructions for using the interface
hsl_ma86_install.m      Matlab code for installing HSL_MA86 and interface
hsl_ma86_test.m         Simple Matlab test example
hsl_ma86_full_test.m    Matlab test code aimed at fully exercising the interface
hsl_ma87_backslash.m    Matlab code for interface
hsl_ma87_destroy.m      Matlab code for interface
hsl_ma87_expert.m       Matlab code for interface
hsl_ma87_factor.m       Matlab code for interface
hsl_ma87_solve.m        Matlab code for interface
hsl_matlab.F90          Generic Fortran code for HSL Matlab interfaces
hsl_ma86_expert.f90     Fortran code for Matlab interface
common90.g95.f90        Alternate version of ../src/common90.f90 with workaround
                        for g95 bug.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
3. Installation of hsl_ma86 and its Matlab interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- Extract the hsl_ma86 archive into the desired directory.
- Start matlab
- Navigate to the directory containing the extracted files
- To install the interface, use the function hsl_ma86_install as follows.

    hsl_ma86_install() installs HSL_MA86 and its Matlab Interface. It is
       assumed that the BLAS and LAPACK routines provided by MATLAB
       are used, and mex is configured to use your preferred compiler.
       The test example is not run.

    hsl_ma86_install(TEST) installs HSL_MA86 and its Matlab Interface and
       optionally runs the test example. It is assumed that the BLAS and LAPACK
       routines provided with the interface are used, and mex is configured to
       use your preferred compiler.
       If TEST <= 0, the test example is not run;
       if TEST > 0, the test example is run and the user can compare the output
       with that of the file OUT/install.output. Note that there may be very
       small differences because of the arithmetic differing on different
       computers.

    hsl_ma86_install(TEST,LIBS) installs HSL_MA86 and its Matlab Interface
       and optionally runs the test example. It is assumed that mex is
       configured to use your preferred compiler.
       If LIBS has the value 'matlab' this is equivalent to the
         setting LIBS='-lmwlapack -lmwblas'. In addition it will compile the
         file nometis.f to signal that metis is not available.
         Use of this option on a 64-bit platform will force use of 64-bit
         default integers and may impede the performance of the HSL code. 
       Otherwise LIBS should be set to specify which BLAS and MeTiS to link
         against, and may optionally specify the location of other libraries
         (eg libf95.a libgcc.a if they are not on a default search path).
         Typically this will take the form of
         LIBS='-L/path/to/blas -lblas -L/path/to/metis -lmetis'.

    hsl_ma86_install(TEST,LIBS,MEXFLAGS) installs HSL_MA86 and its Matlab
       Interface and optionally runs the test example. The contents of the
       variable MEXFLAGS is passed to mex as follows.
         mex $(MEXFLAGS) -c file.F90
         mex $(MEXFLAGS) $(LIBS) -output foo.mex file.F90
      If MEXFLAGS is not supplied it assumes the default value of
        '-largeArrayDims' on a 64-bit platform and is empty on a 32-bit
        platform.
      If MEXFLAGS is supplied and BLAS='matlab' on a 64-bit machine, the user
        must ensure that the relevant flag to force 64-bit default integers is
        passed to the compiler by explicitly setting FFLAGS='-i8 -fPIC' (g95) or
        '-fdefault-real-8 -fPIC' (gfortran). (The -fPIC is needed as the mex
        default value of FFLAGS uses -fPIC to create a shared library).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
4. Instructions for best performance
-----------------------------------------------------------------
For best performance we recommend that:
   * 32-bit integer BLAS are provided, allowing HSL_MA86 to work internally
     with 32-bit integers.
   * Metis ordering is provided. You will need to ensure that the metis library
     is compiled with the -fPIC option.
   * OpenMP is enabled. This will require an OpenMP compliant compiler, such
     as gfortran (while not officially supported by MATLAB prior to 2011a, in
     our experience it works so long as the version matches that of the
     supported gcc).

On our testing machine, the following options are used to compile with
gfortran, OpenMP, MKL BLAS and MeTiS:

% Note: we need to repeat the mkl libraries twice to ensure all symbols are
% resolved correctly as mex doesn't easily allow use of -Wl,--start-group
MKLPATH = '/opt/intel/composerxe-2011/mkl/lib/intel64'
MKLLIB = [MKLPATH '/libmkl_gf_lp64.a ' MKLPATH '/libmkl_sequential.a ' MKLPATH '/libmkl_core.a ']
METIS = '-L/usr/local/metis-4.0-shared -lmetis'
MEXFLAGS = 'FC="gfortran-4.3" FFLAGS="-fopenmp \$FFLAGS" LDFLAGS="-fopenmp \$LDFLAGS" -largeArrayDims'
hsl_ma86_install(1,[MKLLIB MKLLIB METIS],MEXFLAGS)

These may require adaption if your libraries reside in different locations.

If you wish to use only the matlab libraries with gfortran for OpenMP support,
the following options could be used.

LIBS = 'matlab'
MEXFLAGS = 'FC=gfortran-4.3 F77=gfortran-4.3 FFLAGS=''-fopenmp -fdefault-integer-8 \$FFLAGS'' LDFLAGS=''-fopenmp \$LDFLAGS'' -largeArrayDims'
hsl_ma86_install(1,LIBS,MEXFLAGS)
