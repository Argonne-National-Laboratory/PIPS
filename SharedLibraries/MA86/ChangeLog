Version 1.3.0
   * Fix bug on some symbolically structural matrices where analysis phase
     reports allocation error rather than singular warning/error.
   * Implement workarounds for various ifort bugs (particularly under windows).
   * Fix crash bug relating to destruction of locks on allocation failure.

Version 1.2.0
   * Change C interface control.small to control.small_ to avoid collision
     with Microsoft C reserved word.
   * Add control%scaling
   * Modify behaviour of optional scale parameter (see control%scaling)
   * Fix bug where OpenMP locks were not destroyed properly in lfactor data
     structure when running the factorize phase a second time.
   * Numerous (mostly minor) performance enhacements based on comparison with
     MA57 on small and rank deficient matrices:
      * Remove lcol_new - always construct in colwork (rather than lcol), then
        copy to lcol when done
      * Optimise loops and variable naming in MA64 code for better performance
      * Move test on second column so only performed if 2x2 pivot is good
      * Cache value from scanning a column that is passed over in favour of
        trying for a 2x2
      * Avoid updates in MA64 code with zero columns
      * Do ma64_update block columnwise to avoid ops with upper entries on
        large columns
      * Avoid passing arrays as allocatables to inner kernels by allocating to
        correct size at top level [avoids Fortran datatype packing overheads]
      * Store delays columnwise after rowwise factors
      * Split handling of leafnodes away from non-leaf nodes, allowing
        construction in a colwise fashion without worry about delays etc.

Version 1.1.0
   * Make members private by default.
   * Add matlab interface.
   * Add C interface.
   * Add optional scale parameter.
   * Fix missing argument in documentation.
   * Several small performance improvements
   * Reduce use of log function in calculating info%detlog (can be massive
     performance overhead)
   * Fix bug with info%flag values carried incorrectly between subsequent
     calls to ma86_factor/ma86_factor_solve
