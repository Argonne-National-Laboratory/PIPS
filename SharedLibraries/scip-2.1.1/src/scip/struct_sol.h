/** primal CIP solution
 *
 *  For reasons of efficiency, a working solution only stores values that have been accessed at least once,
 *  or that have been changed from the value in the solution's source.
 *  The user has to call SCIPsolUnlink() in order to retrieve all non-cached elements from the solution's source
 *  and to store the values in the solution's own array. This changes the solution's origin to SCIP_SOLORIGIN_ZERO.
 *  A linked solution with origin SCIP_SOLORIGIN_LPSOL or SCIP_SOLORIGIN_PSEUDOSOL becomes invalid after the
 *  next node is focused (i.e. the LP and pseudo solutions changed) and cannot be accessed anymore.
 *
 *  Solutions with origin ORIGINAL contain the values for original variables. The stored objective value also
 *  corresponds to the original problem.
