    *  In the SCIPinferVarLbCons() and SCIPinferVarUbCons() calls, the handler provides the constraint, that deduced the
    *  variable's bound change, and an integer value "inferinfo" that can be arbitrarily chosen.
    *  The propagation conflict resolving method must then be implemented, to provide the "reasons" for the bound
    *  changes, i.e. the bounds of variables at the time of the propagation, that forced the constraint to set the
    *  conflict variable's bound to its current value. It can use the "inferinfo" tag to identify its own propagation
    *  rule and thus identify the "reason" bounds. The bounds that form the reason of the assignment must then be provided
    *  by calls to SCIPaddConflictLb() and SCIPaddConflictUb() in the propagation conflict resolving method.
    *
    *  For example, the logicor constraint c = "x or y or z" fixes variable z to TRUE (i.e. changes the lower bound of z
    *  to 1.0), if both, x and y, are assigned to FALSE (i.e. if the upper bounds of these variables are 0.0). It uses
    *  SCIPinferVarLbCons(scip, z, 1.0, c, 0) to apply this assignment (an inference information tag is not needed by the
    *  constraint handler and is set to 0).
    *  In the conflict analysis, the constraint handler may be asked to resolve the lower bound change on z with
    *  constraint c, that was applied at a time given by a bound change index "bdchgidx".
    *  With a call to SCIPvarGetLbAtIndex(z, bdchgidx), the handler can find out, that the lower bound of variable z was
    *  set to 1.0 at the given point of time, and should call SCIPaddConflictUb(scip, x, bdchgidx) and
    *  SCIPaddConflictUb(scip, y, bdchgidx) to tell SCIP, that the upper bounds of x and y at this point of time were
    *  the reason for the deduction of the lower bound of z.

    *  - If the constraint may get violated by decreasing the value of a variable, it should call
    *    SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, var, nlockspos, nlocksneg), saying that rounding down is potentially rendering the
    *    (positive) constraint infeasible and rounding up is potentially rendering the negation of the constraint
    *    infeasible.
    *  - If the constraint may get violated by increasing the value of a variable, it should call
    *    SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, var, nlocksneg, nlockspos), saying that rounding up is potentially rendering the
    *    constraint's negation infeasible and rounding up is potentially rendering the constraint itself
    *    infeasible.
    *  - If the constraint may get violated by changing the variable in any direction, it should call
    *    SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, var, nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg).
    *
    *  Consider the linear constraint "3x -5y +2z <= 7" as an example. The variable rounding lock method of the
    *  linear constraint handler should call SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, x, nlocksneg, nlockspos), 
    *  SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, y, nlockspos, nlocksneg) and SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, z, nlocksneg, nlockspos) to tell SCIP,
    *  that rounding up of x and z and rounding down of y can destroy the feasibility of the constraint, while rounding
    *  down of x and z and rounding up of y can destroy the feasibility of the constraint's negation "3x -5y +2z > 7".
    *  A linear constraint "2 <= 3x -5y +2z <= 7" should call
    *  SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, ..., nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg) on all variables, since rounding in both
    *  directions of each variable can destroy both the feasibility of the constraint and it's negation
    *  "3x -5y +2z < 2  or  3x -5y +2z > 7".
    *
    *  If the constraint itself contains other constraints as sub constraints (e.g. the "or" constraint concatenation
    *  "c(x) or d(x)"), the rounding lock methods of these constraints should be called in a proper way.
    *  - If the constraint may get violated by the violation of the sub constraint c, it should call
    *    SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlockspos, nlocksneg), saying that infeasibility of c may lead to infeasibility of
    *    the (positive) constraint, and infeasibility of c's negation (i.e. feasibility of c) may lead to infeasibility
    *    of the constraint's negation (i.e. feasibility of the constraint).
    *  - If the constraint may get violated by the feasibility of the sub constraint c, it should call
    *    SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlocksneg, nlockspos), saying that infeasibility of c may lead to infeasibility of
    *    the constraint's negation (i.e. feasibility of the constraint), and infeasibility of c's negation (i.e. feasibility
    *    of c) may lead to infeasibility of the (positive) constraint.
    *  - If the constraint may get violated by any change in the feasibility of the sub constraint c, it should call
    *    SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg).
    *
    *  Consider the or concatenation "c(x) or d(x)". The variable rounding lock method of the or constraint handler
    *  should call SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlockspos, nlocksneg) and SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, d, nlockspos, nlocksneg)
    *  to tell SCIP, that infeasibility of c and d can lead to infeasibility of "c(x) or d(x)".
    *
    *  As a second example, consider the equivalence constraint "y <-> c(x)" with variable y and constraint c. The
    *  constraint demands, that y == 1 if and only if c(x) is satisfied. The variable lock method of the corresponding
    *  constraint handler should call SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, y, nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg) and
    *  SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg), because any modification to the

    *  reductions made in the copied SCIP instance can be transfer to the original SCIP instance. If the valid pointer is
    *  set to TRUE and it was not one to one copy, it might happen that optimal solutions are cut off.
