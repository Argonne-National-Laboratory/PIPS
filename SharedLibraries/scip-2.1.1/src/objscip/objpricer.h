    *  reduced costs for non-negative variables, positive reduced costs for non-positive variables,
    *  and non-zero reduced costs for variables that can be negative and positive.
    *
    *  The method is called in the LP solving loop after an LP was proven to be feasible.
    *
    *  Whenever the pricer finds a variable with negative feasibility, it should call SCIPcreateVar()
    *  and SCIPaddPricedVar() to add the variable to the problem. Furthermore, it should call the appropriate
    *  methods of the constraint handlers to add the necessary variable entries to the constraints.
    *
    *  In the usual case that the pricer either adds a new variable or ensures that there are no further variables with negative dual feasibility,
    *  the result pointer should be set to SCIP_SUCCESS. Only if the pricer aborts pricing without creating a new variable, but
    *  there might exist additional variables with negative dual feasibility, the result pointer should be set to SCIP_DIDNOTRUN.
    *  In this case, which sometimes is referred to as "early branching", the lp solution will not be used as a lower bound. 
    *  The pricer can, however, store a valid lower bound in the lowerbound pointer.
    *  If you use your own branching rule (e.g., to branch on constraints), make sure that it is able to branch on pseudo solutions. 
    *  Otherwise, SCIP will use its default branching rules (which all branch on variables). This
    *  could disturb the pricing problem or branching might not even be possible, e.g., if all yet created variables have already been fixed.

    *  The LP was proven infeasible, so we have an infeasibility proof by the dual farkas multipliers y.
