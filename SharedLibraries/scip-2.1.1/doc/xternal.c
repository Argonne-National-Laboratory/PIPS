 *
 *
 * <b>What is SCIP?</b>
 *
 * SCIP is a framework to solve constraint integer programs (CIPs). In particular,
 *
 * - SCIP is a branch-and-cut-and-price framework,
 * - incorporates a full-scale mixed integer programming (MIP) solver, and
 * - incorporates a full-scale mixed integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) solver.
 *
 * See the web site of <a href="http://scip.zib.de">SCIP</a> for more information about licensing and to download SCIP.
 *
 * SCIP is developed together with <a href="http://www.tu-braunschweig.de/mo/">TU Braunschweig</a> and <a
 * href="http://www.am.uni-erlangen.de/optimization/edom.html">University of Erlangen-N&uuml;rnberg (Chair of EDOM)</a>
 * and has more than 450,000 lines of C code.

/**@page CODE Coding style guidelines
 *
 * We follow the following coding style guidelines and recommend them for all developers.
 *
 * - Indentation is 3 spaces. No tabs anywhere in the code.
 * - Always only one declaration in a line.
 * - Braces are on a new line and not indented.
 * - Spaces around all operators.
 * - No spaces between control structure keywords like "if", "for", "while", "switch" and the corresponding brackets.
 * - No spaces between a function name and the parenthesis in both the definition and function calls.
 * - Use assert() to show preconditions for the parameters, invariants and postconditions.
 * - All global functions start with "SCIP". In the usual naming scheme this is followed by the object and a method name
 *   like in SCIPlpAddRow(). Functions return TRUE or FALSE should be named like SCIPisFeasEQ().
 * - Make all functions that are not used outside the module 'static'. Naming should start with a lower case letter.
 * - Variable names should be all lower case.
 * - For each structure there is a typedef with the name in all upper case.
 * - Defines should be named all upper case.
 * - Document functions, parameters, and variables in a doxygen conformed way.
 *
 * As an example, have a look at tree.c and see the examples below. We also provide settings for
 * \ref XEMACS "(x)emacs" and \ref ECLIPSE "eclipse".
 *
 * @section CODEEXAMPLES Examples
 *
 * In this section we state a few examples illustrating the \SCIP code style.

/**@page MAKE Makefiles / Installation information
 *
 *
 * In most cases (LINUX and MAC) it is quite easy to compile and install SCIP. Therefore, reading the section
 * \ref BRIEFINSTALL "Brief installation description" should usually be enough. If this is not the case you find
 * \ref DETAILEDINSTALL "Detailed installation description" below as well as \ref EXAMPLE1 "Examples".
*
 * @section BRIEFINSTALL Brief installation description
 *
 * The easiest way to install SCIP is to use the ZIB Optimization Suite which contains SCIP, SoPlex, and ZIMPL. For
 * that we refer to the INSTALL file of the ZIB Optimization Suite (In case of the ZIB Optimization Suite, there is not need
 * to specify any directories, the compiling process is fully automated).
 *
 * Compiling SCIP directly can be done as follows:
 *
 * -# unpack the tarball <code>tar xvf scip-x.y.z.tgz</code>
 * -# change into the directory <code>cd scip-x.y.z</code>
 * -# start compiling SCIP <code>make</code>
 * -# (optional) install the header, libraries, and binary <code>make install INSTALLDIR="/usr/local/</code>
 *
 * During your first compilation you will be asked for some soft-link targets,
 * depending on the LP solver you want to use. Usually, SCIP needs the
 * following information
 * -# the directory where the include files of the LP solver lie
 * -# the library file(s) "lib*.a" or/and "lib*.so"
 *
 * Beside that, SCIP needs some soft-link targets, for ZIMPL
 * -# the directory where the include files of ZIMPL lie
 * -# the library file(s) "lib*.a" or/and "lib*.so"
 *
 * You will need either the .a or the .so files and can skip the others by
 * just pressing return.
 *
 * @section DETAILEDINSTALL Detailed installation description
 *
 * In this section we describe the use, and a few features, of the SCIP Makefile. We also give two examples for how to install
 * SCIP. The \ref EXAMPLE1 "first example" illustrates the default installation. This means, with SoPleX and ZIMPL. The
 * \ref EXAMPLE2 "second example" shows how to get CPLEX linked to SCIP without ZIMPL. This is followed by a section which
 * gives some hints on what to do if the \ref COMPILERPROBLEMS "compilation throws an error". We give some comments on
 * how to install SCIP under \ref WINDOWS "WINDOWS" and show \ref RUN "how to start SCIP".
 *
 * If you experience any problems during the installation, you will find help in the \ref INSTALL "INSTALL" file.
 *
 * SCIP contains a makefile system, which allows the individual setting of several parameters. For
 * instance, the following settings are supported:
 *
 * - <code>OPT=\<dbg|opt|opt-gccold\></code> Here <code>dbg</code> turns on the debug mode of SCIP. This enables asserts
 *   and avoids macros for several function in order to ease debugging. The default is <code>opt</code>, which enables
 *   the optimized mode. The third option <code>opt-gccold</code> will work with older GCC compilers before version
 *   4.2. We recommend using newer GCC versions.
 *
 * - <code>LPS=\<clp|cpx|grb|msk|qso|spx|xprs|none\></code> This determines the LP-solver, which should have been
 *   installed separately from SCIP. The options are the following:
 *      - <code>clp</code>: COIN-OR Clp LP-solver
 *      - <code>cpx</code>: CPLEX LP-solver
 *      - <code>grb</code>: Gurobi LP-solver (interface is in beta stage)
 *      - <code>msk</code>: Mosek LP-solver
 *      - <code>qso</code>: QSopt LP-solver
 *      - <code>spx</code>: SoPlex LP-solver (default)
 *      - <code>xprs</code>: XPress LP-solver
 *      - <code>none</code>: no LP-solver (you should set the parameter \<lp/solvefreq\> to \<-1\> to avoid solving LPs)
 *
 * - <code>LPSOPT=\<dbg|opt|opt-gccold\></code> Chooses the debug or optimized version (or old GCC optimized) version of
 *   the LP-solver. (currently only available for SoPlex and CLP)
 *
 * - <code>ZIMPL=\<true|false\></code> Turns direct support of ZIMPL in SCIP on (default) or off, respectively.
 * - <code>ZIMPLOPT=\<dbg|opt|opt-gccold\></code> Chooses the debug or optimized (default) (or old GCC optimized)
 *   version of ZIMPL, if ZIMPL support is enabled. \n
 *   If the ZIMPL-support is disabled, the GMP-library is no longer needed for SCIP and therefore not linked to SCIP.
 *
 * - <code>READLINE=\<true|false\></code> Turns support via the readline library on (default) or off, respectively.
 *
 * - <code>IPOPT=\<true|false\></code> to enable/disable(default) IPOPT interface (needs IPOPT)
 *
 * - <code>EXPRINT=\<cppad|none\></code>   to use CppAD as expressions interpreter or no expressions interpreter (default)
 *
 * There are additional parameters for Linux/Gnu compilers:
 *
 * - <code>OPT=noblkmem</code> turns off the internal SCIP memory.  This way the code can be checked by valgrind or
 *   similar tools.
 * - <code>OPT=opt-shared</code> generates a shared object of the SCIP libraries.  (The binary uses these shared
 *   libraries as well.)
 * - <code>OPT=prf</code> generates a profiling version of SCIP providing a detailed statistic of the time usage of
 *   every method of SCIP.
 *
 * You can use other compilers - depending on the system:
 *
 * - <code>COMP=intel</code> Uses of the Intel compiler which is only available with the main optimization flags
 *   <code>OPT=\<dbg|opt\></code>. (Default is gcc/g++ represented through <code>COMP=gnu</code>.)
 *
 * There is the possibility to watch the compilation more precisely:
 *
 * - <code>VERBOSE=\<true|false\></code> Turns the extensive output on or off (default).
 *
 * The SCIP makefile supports several targets (used via <code>make ... "target"</code>):
 *
 * - <code>links</code> Reconfigures the links in the "lib" directory.
 * - <code>doc</code> Creates documentation in the "doc" directory.
 * - <code>clean</code> Removes all object files.
 * - <code>depend</code> Creates dependencies files. This is only needed if you add files to SCIP.
 * - <code>check</code> Runs the check script, see \ref TEST.
 *
 * The SCIP makefiles are structured as follows.
 *
 * - <code>Makefile</code> This is the basic makefile in the SCIP root directory. It loads
 *   additional makefile information depending on the parameters set.
 * - <code>make/make.project</code> This file contains definitions that are useful for all codes
 *   that use SCIP, for instance, the examples.
 * - <code>make.\<sys\>.\<machine\>.\<compiler\>.\<dbg|opt|prf|opt-gccold\></code> These file contain system/compiler specific
 *   definitions. If you have an unsupported compiler, you can copy one of these and modify it
 *   accordingly.
 *
 * If your platform or compiler is not supported by SCIP you might try and copy one of the existing
 * makefiles in the <code>make</code> directory and modify it. If you succeed, we are always
 * interested in including more Makefiles into the system.
 *
 *
 * @section EXAMPLE1 Example 1 (defaults: SoPlex, with ZIMPL support):
 *
 * Typing <code>make</code> uses SoPlex as LP solver and includes support for the modeling language ZIMPL. You will be asked the
 * following questions on the first call to "make" (example answers are already given):

 * @section COMPILERPROBLEMS Compilation problems:
 *
 * - If the soft-link query script does not work on your machine, read step 2 in the \ref INSTALL "INSTALL" file for
 * instructions on manually creating the soft-links.
 *
 * - If you get an error message of the type\n
 * <code>make: *** No rule to make target `lib/???', needed by `obj/O.linux.x86.gnu.opt/lib/scip/???.o'.  Stop.</code>\n
 * the corresponding soft-link was not created or points to a wrong location.  Check the soft-link targets in the "lib/"
 * subdirectory. Try to delete all soft-links from the "lib/" directory\n and call "make links" to generate them
 * again. If this still fails, read step 2 for instructions on manually\n creating the soft-links.
 *
 * - If you get an error message of the type\n
 * <code>make: *** No rule to make target `make/make.?.?.?.?.?'.  Stop.</code>,\n
 * the corresponding machine dependent makefile for your architecture and compiler is missing.\n Create one of the given
 * name in the "make/" subdirectory. You may take\n "make/make.linux.x86.gnu.opt" or any other file in the make
 * subdirectory as example.\n
 *
 * - The readline library seems to differ slightly on different OS distributions. Some versions do
 * not support the <code>remove_history()</code> call.  In this case, you have to either add
 * <code>-DNO_REMOVE_HISTORY</code> to the FLAGS in the appropriate "make/make.*" file, or to
 * compile with <code>make USRFLAGS=-DNO_REMOVE_HISTORY</code>.  Make sure, the file
 * "src/scip/dialog.c" is recompiled.  If this doesn't work either, disable the readline library
 * with <code>make READLINE=false</code>.
 *
 * - On some systems, the <code>sigaction()</code> method is not available. In this case, you have
 * to either add <code>-DNO_SIGACTION</code> to the FLAGS in the appropriate "make/make.*" file, or
 * to compile with <code>make USRFLAGS=-DNO_SIGACTION</code>.  Make sure, the file
 * "src/scip/interrupt.c" is recompiled.
 *
 * - On some systems, the <code>rand_r()</code> method is not available.  In this case, you have to either add
 * <code>-DNO_RAND_R</code> to the FLAGS in the appropriate "make/make.*" file, or to compile with
 * <code>make USRFLAGS=-DNO_RAND_R</code>.  Make sure, the file "src/scip/misc.c" is recompiled.
 *
 * - On some systems, the <code>strtok_r()</code> method is not available.  In this case, you have
 * to either add <code>-DNO_STRTOK_R</code> to the FLAGS in the appropriate make/make.* file, or to
 * compile with <code>make USRFLAGS=-DNO_STRTOK_R</code>.  Make sure, the file "src/scip/misc.c" is
 * recompiled.
 *
 * - On some systems, the <code>strerror_r()</code> method is not available.  In this case, you have
 * to either add <code>-DNO_STRERROR_R</code> to the FLAGS in the appropriate "make/make.*" file, or
 * to compile with <code>make USRFLAGS=-DNO_STRERROR_R</code>.  Make sure, the file
 * "src/scip/misc.c" is recompiled.
 *
 * - On some systems, the option [-e] is not available for the read command.  You have to compile with READ=read.
 *
 * - If you encounter other compiler or linker errors, you should recompile with <code>make
 * VERBOSE=true ...</code> in order to get the full compiler invocation. This might help to fix the
 * corresponding machine dependent makefile in the make subdirectory.
 *
 * @section WINDOWS Remarks on Installing under Windows using MinGW
 *
 * To build your own windows binaries under windows we recommend using the MinGW-Compiler with MSYS
 * from <a href="http://www.mingw.org">www.mingw.org</a> .
 *
 * First install MSYS, then MinGW to the mingw folder inside the msys folder.
 * Now you need to install the following packages to the mingw folder:
 * - zlib (or use ZLIB=false)
 * - pcre (here suffices the pcre7.0-lib.zip (or equivalent) to be extracted into the mingw-folder)
 *
 * After calling <code>make clean</code> in the ZIMPL folder you will also need flex and bison to
 * remake ZIMPL. We recommend NOT to use <code>"make clean"</code> inside the ZIMPL-folder if you do
 * not have these packages installed.
 *
 * You can download these additional packages from <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html">here</a>
 * or compile the source on your own from their homepages.
 *
 * Second you need to copy the file <code>sh.exe</code> to <code>bash.exe</code> otherwise various
 * scripts (including makefiles) will not work.  Normally <code>unistd.h</code> covers also the
 * getopt-options, but for mingw you need to add the entry <code>\#include <getopt.h></code> into
 * "/mingw/include/unistd.h" after the other include-entries (if not present).
 *
 * Finally, there is one package you need to compile if you want to use ZIMPL and ZIMPL-support in
 * SCIP (otherwise use <code>ZIMPL=false</code> as parameter with the make-call): the
 * <code>gmplib</code> from <a href="http://www.gmplib.org">gmplib.org</a>. The command
 * <code>./configure --prefix=/mingw ; make ; make install</code> should succeed without problems
 * and installs the gmplib to the mingw folder.
 *
 * Now <code>make READLINE=false</code> should be compiling without errors.  Please note that we
 * do NOT support creating the doxygen documentation and readline-usage under windows.
 *
 *
 * @section RUN How to run SCIP after successful compiling SCIP
 *
 * To run the program enter <code>bin/scip.\$(OSTYPE).\$(ARCH).\$(COMP).\$(OPT).\$(LPS)</code>
 * (e.g. <code>bin/scip.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.spx</code>) or just <code>bin/scip</code> for the last compiled version.

/**@page START How to start a new project
 *
 * If you want to use SCIP to write your own branch-and-cut or branch-and-cut-and-price code, below
 * you find some hints of how to start a new project.
 *
 * - Copy one of the examples in the <code>examples</code> directory (in the SCIP root
 *   directory). Depending on the programming language (<b>C</b> or <b>C++</b>) and the purpose
 *   (<b>branch-and-cut</b> or <b>branch-and-cut-and-price</b>) of your project
 *   we suggest the use one of the following examples as starting point:
 *     - <code>VRP</code> should be used if your focus is <b>branch-and-cut-and-price</b>
 *       (column generation) and you want to use <b>C++</b>.
 *     - <code>Coloring</code> or <code>Binpacking</code> should be used if your focus is
 *       <b>branch-and-cut-and-price</b> (column generation) and you want to use <b>C</b>.
 *     - <code>TSP</code> should be used if your focus is <b>branch-and-cut</b> and you want to use <b>C++</b>.
 *     - <code>LOP</code> should be used if your focus is <b>branch-and-cut</b> and you want to use <b>C</b>.
 * - Edit the makefile according to your needs - in particular:
 *    - include a correct path to the SCIP root at the top (<code>SCIPDIR</code>)
 *    - you should rename the targets name (<code>MAINNAME</code>)
 *    - and you should adjust the source file names (<code>MAINOBJ</code>).
 * - Once you have edited the makefile, you can use all the flags that can be used in SCIP to
 *   compile your code, see \ref MAKE.
 *
 */


/**@page SHELL Tutorial: the interactive shell
 *
 * If are using SCIP as a black box solver, here you will find some tips and tricks what you can do.
 *
 * First of all, we need a SCIP binary and an example problem file to work with.  Therefore, you can either download the
 * SCIP standard distribution (which includes problem files) and compile it on your own or you can download a
 * precompiled binary and an example problem separately. SCIP can read files in LP, MPS, ZPL, WBO, FZN, PIP, and other formats.
 *
 * If you want to download the source code of the SCIP standard distribution, we recommend to go to the <a
 * href="http://zibopt.zib.de/download.shtml">ZIBopt download section</a>, download the latest release (version 2.1 as
 * of this writing), inflate the tarball (e.g., with "tar xzf ziboptsuite-[version].tgz"), and follow the instructions
 * in the INSTALL file. The instance stein27, which will serve as an example in this tutorial, can be found under
 * ziboptsuite-[version]/scip-[version]/check/instances/MIP/stein27.mps.
 *
 * If you want to download a precompiled binary, go to the <a href="http://scip.zib.de/download.shtml">SCIP download
 * section</a> and download an appropriate binary for your operating system. To follow this tutorial, we recommend downloading the instance
 * <a href="http://miplib.zib.de/miplib3/miplib3/stein27.mps.gz">stein27</a> from the <a href="http://miplib.zib.de/miplib3/miplib3.html">MIPLIB 3.0</a> homepage.
 *
 * Now start your binary, without any arguments. This opens the interactive shell, which should look somehow like this:

 * What do we see here? After "optimize", SCIP first goes into presolving. Not much is happening for this instance, just
 * the linear constraints get upgraded to more specific types. Each round of presolving will be displayed in a single
 * line, with a short summary at the end. Here, there has only been one round with actual changes, the second round did
 * not bring any further reductions.  Thus, it is not displayed and presolving is stopped. Then, we see the actual
 * solving process. The first three output lines indicate that new incumbent solutions were found by the primal
 * heuristics with display characters "t", "R", and "s"; see, how the "primalbound" column goes down from 27 to 25. In
 * the fourth line, two "cuts" are added.  Up to here, we needed 44 "LP iter"ations (34 for the first LP and 10 more to
 * resolve after adding cuts). Little later, the root node processing is finished. We see that there are now two open
 * nodes in the "left" column. From now on, we will see an output line every hundredth node or whenever a new incumbent
 * is found (e.g. at node 14 in the above output). After some more nodes, the "dualbound" starts moving, too. At one
 * point, both will be the same, and the solving process terminates, showing us some wrap-up information.
 *
 * The exact performance varies amongst different architectures, operating systems, and so on. Do not be worried if
 * your installation needs more or less time or nodes to solve. Also, this instance has more than 2000 different optimal
 * solutions. The optimal objective value always has to be 18, but the solution vector may differ. If you are interested
 * in this behavior, which is called "performance variability", you may have a look at the MIPLIB2010 paper.
 *
 * We might want to have some more information now. Which were the heuristics that found the solutions? What plugins
 *  were called during the solutions process and how much time did they spend? How did the instance that we were solving
 *  look?  Information on certain plugin types (e.g., heuristics, branching rules, separators) we get by
 *  "display <plugin-type>", information on the solution process, we get by "display statistics", and "display problem"
 *  shows us the current instance.

 * We see that rounding and shifting were the heuristics producing the solutions in the beginning. Rounding is called at
 * every node, shifting only at every tenth level of the tree. The statistics are quite comprehensive, thus, we just
 * explain a few lines here. We get information for all types of plugins and for the overall solving process. Besides
 * others, we see that in six calls, the gomory cut separator and the strong Chv&aacute;tal-Gomory separator each produced
 * several hundred cuts (of which only a few entered the LP). The oneopt heuristic found one solution in 4 calls,
 * whereas coefdiving failed all 57 times it was called. All the LPs have been solved with the dual simplex algorithm, which
 * took about 0.2 seconds of the 0.7 seconds overall solving time.
 *
 * Now, we can start playing around with parameters. Rounding and shifting seem to be quite successful on this instance,
 * wondering what happens if we disable them? Or what happens, if we are even more rigorous and disable all heuristics?
 * Or if we do the opposite and use aggressive heuristics?

 * Okay, what happened here? First, we reset all parameters to their default values, using "set default". Next, we
 * loaded some meta-parameter settings (also see <a href="FAQ.html#Section2">the FAQ</a>), to apply primal heuristics
 * more aggressively. SCIP shows us, which single parameters it changed therefor. Now, the optimal solution is already
 * found at the root node, by a heuristic which is deactivated by default.  Then, after node 200, the user pressed
 * CTRL-C which interrupts the solving process, We see that now in the short status report, primal and dual bound are
 * different, thus, the problem is not solved yet.  Nevertheless, we could access statistics, see the current incumbent
 * solution, change parameters and so on. Entering "optimize" we continue the solving process from the point on at which
 * it has been interrupted.
 *
 * SCIP can also write information to files. E.g., we could store the incumbent solution to a file, or output the
 * problem instance in another file format (the LP format is much more human readable than the MPS format, for example).
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP> write solution stein27.sol

/**@page DOC How to search the documentation for interface methods
 *
 * If you are looking for a method in order to perform a specific task, there are usually two places to look at:
 * - The file "scip.h" in the file list.
 *   In this main header file, you find all methods that perform "complex" operations that affect or need data from
 *   different components of SCIP.
 *   For these methods, you always have to provide the SCIP pointer that is created by SCIPcreate().
 *   The documentation of "scip.h" is grouped into several blocks, each dealing with methods for a specific kind of
 *   object.
 *   For example, all methods operating on variables are grouped together.

 * - The files \ref PUBLICMETHODS "pub_<...>.h" contain methods that perform "easy" operations that only
 *   affect the corresponding objects.
 *   Usually, with these methods you can access the data of the object.
 *   For example, in "pub_var.h" you find methods to get information about a variable.
 *
 * The file "pub_misc.h" contains methods for data structures like priority queues, hash tables, and hash maps,
 * as well as methods for sorting, numerics, random numbers, string operations, and file operations.
 *
 * If you are looking for a description of a callback method of a plugin that you want to implement, you have to
 * look at the corresponding \ref TYPEDEFINITIONS "type_<...>.h".

/**@page CONS How to add constraint handlers
 *
 * A constraint handler defines the semantics and the algorithms to process constraints of a certain class.  A single
 * constraint handler is responsible for all constraints belonging to its constraint class.  For example, there is
 * one \ref cons_knapsack.h "knapsack constraint handler" that ensures solutions are only accepted if they satisfy all
 * knapsack constraints in the model. \n A complete list of all constraint handlers contained in this release can be
 * found \ref CONSHDLRS "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own constraint handlers.
 * For an example, look into the subtour constraint handler (examples/TSP/src/ConshdlrSubtour.cpp) of the
 * TSP example project.
 * The example is written in C++ and uses the C++ wrapper classes.
 * However, we will explain the implementation of a constraint handler using the C interface.
 * It is very easy to transfer the C explanation to C++; whenever a method should be implemented using the
 * SCIP_DECL_CONS... notion, reimplement the corresponding virtual member function of the abstract scip::ObjConshdlr
 * base class.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a constraint handler can be found in the file
 * type_cons.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do (assuming your constraint handler should be named "subtour"):
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/cons_xyz.c and src/scip/cons_xyz.h into files "cons_subtour.c"
 *    and "cons_subtour.h".
      \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "subtour".
 * -# Adjust the \ref CONS_PROPERTIES "properties of the constraint handler".
 * -# Define the \ref CONS_DATA "constraint data and the constraint handler data". This is optional.
 * -# Implement the \ref CONS_INTERFACE "interface methods".
 * -# Implement the \ref CONS_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS "fundamental callback methods".
 * -# Implement the \ref CONS_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS "additional callback methods". This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section CONS_PROPERTIES Properties of a Constraint Handler
 *
 * At the top of the new file "cons_subtour.c" you can find the constraint handler properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the constraint handler properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjConshdlr from within your constructor (see the TSP example).
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_NAME: the name of the constraint handler.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the constraint handler.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a constraint handler with SCIPfindConshdlr(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two constraint handlers may have the same name.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_DESC: the description of the constraint handler.
 * This string is printed as a description of the constraint handler in the interactive shell of SCIP.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_SEPAPRIORITY: the priority of the constraint handler for separation.
 * In each separation round during the price-and-cut loop of the subproblem processing or during the separation loop
 * of the primal solution separation, the separators and separation methods of the constraint handlers are called in
 * a predefined order, which is given by the priorities of the separators and the separation priorities of the
 * constraint handlers.
 * First, the separators with non-negative priority are called in the order of decreasing priority.
 * Next, the separation methods of the different constraint handlers are called in the order of decreasing separation
 * priority.
 * Finally, the separators with negative priority are called in the order of decreasing priority.
 * \n
 * The separation priority of the constraint handler should be set according to the complexity of the cut separation
 * algorithm and the impact of the resulting cuts:
 * Constraint handlers that provide fast algorithms that usually have a high impact (i.e., cut off a large portion of
 * the LP relaxation) should have a high priority.
 * See \ref CONSSEPALP and \ref CONSSEPASOL for further details of the separation callbacks.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_ENFOPRIORITY: the priority of the constraint handler for constraint enforcing.
 * Like the separation priority, the enforcement priorities define the order in which the different constraint handlers
 * are called in the constraint enforcement step of the subproblem processing.
 * The constraint enforcement is called after the price-and-cut loop is executed (in the case that the LP is solved
 * at the current subproblem).
 * \n
 * The integrality constraint handler has an enforcement priority of 0.
 * That means, if a constraint handler has negative enforcement priority, it only has to deal with integral solutions
 * in its enforcement methods, because for fractional solutions, the integrality constraint handler would have
 * created a branching, thereby aborting the enforcement step.
 * If you want to implement a constraint-depending branching rule (for example, SOS branching on special ordered
 * set constraints), you have to assign a positive enforcement priority to your constraint handler.
 * In this case, you have to be able to deal with fractional solutions.
 * \n
 * See \ref CONSENFOLP and \ref CONSENFOPS for further details of the separation callback.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_CHECKPRIORITY: the priority of the constraint handler for checking feasibility.
 * Like the separation priority, the checking priorities define the order in which the different constraint handlers
 * are called to check the feasibility of a given primal solution candidate.
 * The integrality constraint handler has a checking priority of 0.
 * That means, constraint handlers with negative checking priorities only have to deal with integral solutions.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_SEPAFREQ: the default frequency for separating cuts.
 * The separation frequency defines the depth levels at which the constraint handler's separation methods \ref CONSSEPALP
 * and \ref CONSSEPASOL are called.
 * For example, a separation frequency of 7 means, that the separation callback is executed for subproblems that are
 * in depth 0, 7, 14, ... of the branching tree.
 * A separation frequency of 0 means, that the separation method is only called at the root node.
 * A separation frequency of -1 disables the separation method of the constraint handler.
 * \n
 * The separation frequency can be adjusted by the user.
 * This property of the constraint handler only defines the default value of the frequency.
 * If you want to have a more flexible control of when to execute the separation algorithm, you have to assign
 * a separation frequency of 1 and implement a check at the beginning of your separation algorithm whether you really
 * want to execute the separator or not.
 * If you do not want to execute the method, set the result code to SCIP_DIDNOTRUN.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_PROPFREQ: the default frequency for propagating domains.
 * This default frequency has the same meaning as the CONSHDLR_SEPAFREQ with respect to the domain propagation
 * callback of the constraint handler.
 * A propagation frequency of 0 means that propagation is only applied in preprocessing and at the root node.
 * A propagation frequency of -1 disables the propagation method of the constraint handler.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_EAGERFREQ: the default frequency for using all instead of only the useful constraints in separation, propagation and enforcement.
 * If \em constraint \em aging is activated, some constraints that were not useful in the past for propagation or
 * separation are marked to be \em obsolete.
 * Usually, the obsolete constraints are not presented to the separation and propagation methods of the constraint
 * handlers, such that the constraint handlers only process the non-obsolete constraints.
 * However, every n'th call, with n being the EAGERFREQ of the constraint handler, all constraints are presented to the
 * separation and propagation methods of the constraint handler.
 * This gives obsolete constraints the chance of becoming non-obsolete again.
 * \n
 * If the eager evaluation frequency is set to -1, obsolete constraints are never presented to the separation and
 * propagation methods.
 * A frequency of 0 means, that obsolete constraints are only used in the first call of each method.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_MAXPREROUNDS: the default maximal number of presolving rounds the constraint handler participates in.
 * The preprocessing is executed in rounds.
 * If enough changes have been applied to the model, an additional preprocessing round is performed.
 * The MAXPREROUNDS parameter of a constraint handler denotes the maximal number of preprocessing rounds the constraint
 * handler participates in.
 * A value of -1 means that there is no limit on the number of rounds.
 * A value of 0 means the preprocessing callback of the constraint handler is disabled.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_DELAYSEPA: the default for whether the separation method should be delayed, if other separators found cuts.
 * If the constraint handler's separation method is marked to be delayed, it is only executed after no other separator
 * or constraint handler found a cut during the price-and-cut loop.
 * If the separation method of the constraint handler is very expensive, you may want to mark it to be delayed until all
 * cheap separation methods have been executed.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_DELAYPROP: the default for whether the propagation method should be delayed, if other propagators found reductions.
 * This property is analogous to the DELAYSEPA flag, but deals with the propagation method of the constraint handler.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_DELAYPRESOL: the default for whether the presolving method should be delayed, if other presolvers found reductions.
 * This property is analogous to the DELAYSEPA flag, but deals with the preprocessing method of the constraint handler.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_NEEDSCONS: indicates whether the constraint handler should be skipped, if no constraints are available.
 * Usually, a constraint handler is only executed if there are constraints of its corresponding class in the model.
 * For those constraint handlers, the NEEDSCONS flag should be set to TRUE.
 * However, some constraint handlers must be called without having a constraint of the class in the model, because
 * the constraint is only implicitly available.
 * For example, the integrality constraint handler has the NEEDSCONS flag set to FALSE, because there is no explicit
 * integrality constraint in the model.
 * The integrality conditions are attached to the variables, and the integrality constraint handler has to check
 * all variables that are marked to be integer for integral values.
 *
 * \par CONSHDLR_PROP_TIMING: the propagation timing mask of the constraint handler.
 * SCIP calls the domain propagation routines at different places in the node processing loop.
 * This property indicates at which places the propagation routine of the constraint handler is called.
 * Possible values are defined in type_timing.h and can be concatenated, e.g., as in SCIP_PROPTIMING_ALWAYS.
 *
 * \par LINCONSUPGD_PRIORITY(optional): priority of the constraint handler for upgrading of linear constraints
 * This property is only needed if a certain linear constraint can be upgraded to a more specific one. In one of
 * the first presolving rounds SCIP tries to upgrade linear constraints to more specialized constraints, such as
 * knapsack constraints. The upgrading calls are processed in the order of decreasing priority.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section CONS_DATA Constraint Data and Constraint Handler Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find two structs called "struct SCIP_ConsData" and
 * "struct SCIP_ConshdlrData".
 * If you are using C++, you only need to define the "struct SCIP_ConsData".
 * The constraint handler data must be implemented as member variables of your constraint handler class.
 * \n
 * The constraint data are the information that is needed to define a single constraint of the constraint handler's
 * constraint class.
 * For example, the data of a knapsack constraint would consist of a list of variables, a list of weights, and
 * the capacity of the knapsack.
 * The data of a subtour constraint consists of the graph on which the problem is defined.
 * In the graph, each edge should be linked to the corresponding binary problem variable.
 * \n
 * The constraint handler data are additional variables, that belong to the constraint handler itself and which are
 * not specific to a single constraint.
 * For example, you can use these data to store parameters of the constraint handler or statistical information.
 * The constraint handler data are optional.
 * You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section CONS_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "cons_subtour.c" you can find two interface methods, that also appear in "cons_subtour.h".
 * These are SCIPincludeConshdlrSubtour() and SCIPcreateConsSubtour().
 * \n
 * The method SCIPincludeConshdlrSubtour() only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the constraint handler by calling the method
 * SCIPincludeConshdlr().
 * It is called by the user, if he wants to include the constraint handler, i.e., if he wants to make
 * the constraint handler available to the model.
 *
 * If you are using constraint handler data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &conshdlrdata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_ConshdlrData afterwards.
 *
 * If the constraint handler is a specialization of a linear constraint, you may want to include an automatic
 * upgrade mechanism by calling the interface method
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPincludeLinconsUpgrade(scip, linconsUpgdSubtour, LINCONSUPGD_PRIORITY) );
 * \endcode
 * of the linear constraint handler (see cons_linear.h).
 *
 * You may also add user parameters for your constraint handler.  An
 * example for this and the automatic linear upgrading mechanism can be
 * found in the \ref cons_knapsack.h "knapsack constraint handler".
 *
 * The method SCIPcreateConsSubtour() is called to create a single constraint of the constraint
 * handler's constraint class.
 * It should allocate and fill the constraint data, and call SCIPcreateCons().
 * Take a look at the following example from the \ref cons_knapsack.h "knapsack constraint handler":
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP_RETCODE SCIPcreateConsKnapsack(
 *   SCIP*                 scip,
 *   SCIP_CONS**           cons,
 *   const char*           name,
 *   int                   nvars,
 *   SCIP_VAR**            vars,
 *   SCIP_Longint*         weights,
 *   SCIP_Longint          capacity,
 *   SCIP_Bool             initial,
 *   SCIP_Bool             separate,
 *   SCIP_Bool             enforce,
 *   SCIP_Bool             check,
 *   SCIP_Bool             propagate,
 *   SCIP_Bool             local,
 *   SCIP_Bool             modifiable,
 *   SCIP_Bool             dynamic,
 *   SCIP_Bool             removable,
 *   SCIP_Bool             stickingatnode
 *   )
 * {
 *    SCIP_CONSHDLRDATA* conshdlrdata;
 *    SCIP_CONSHDLR* conshdlr;
 *    SCIP_CONSDATA* consdata;
 *
 *    conshdlr = SCIPfindConshdlr(scip, CONSHDLR_NAME);
 *    if( conshdlr == NULL )
 *    {
 *       SCIPerrorMessage("knapsack constraint handler not found\n");
 *       return SCIP_PLUGINNOTFOUND;
 *    }
 *
 *    conshdlrdata = SCIPconshdlrGetData(conshdlr);
 *    assert(conshdlrdata != NULL);
 *    assert(conshdlrdata->eventhdlr != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( consdataCreate(scip, &consdata, conshdlrdata->eventhdlr, nvars, vars, weights, capacity) );
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPcreateCons(scip, cons, name, conshdlr, consdata, initial, separate, enforce, check, propagate,
 *          local, modifiable, dynamic, removable, stickingatnode) );
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * In this example, consdataCreate() is a local method that allocates memory for the given consdata
 * and fills the data with the given vars array. For allocating memory for the constraint data you
 * can use the method:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocBlockMemory(scip, consdata) );
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * @section CONS_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods
 *
 * By implementing the fundamental callbacks, you define the semantics of the constraint class the constraint handler
 * deals with.
 * If these methods are implemented, the resulting code is already correct and finds the optimal solution to the
 * given problem instance.
 * However, it might be very slow because the additional features, like cut separation and domain propagation, are
 * missing.
 * In the C++ wrapper class scip::ObjConshdlr, the fundamental callback methods are virtual abstract member functions.
 * You have to implement them in order to be able to construct an object of your constraint handler class.
 *
 * There are three fundamental callback methods that are all dealing with the feasibility of a given solution.
 * They are called at different places in the algorithm and have slightly different meaning.
 * However, it is usually reasonable to implement a single local method that is called by all of the three callback
 * methods with slightly modified parameters.
 * The fourth method provides dual information that is used for example in preprocessing.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_cons.h.
 *
 * @subsection CONSCHECK
 *
 * The CONSCHECK callback gets a primal solution candidate in a SCIP_SOL* data structure
 * and has to check this solution for global feasibility.
 * It has to return a result SCIP_FEASIBLE, if the solution satisfies all the constraints of the constraint handler,
 * and a result SCIP_INFEASIBLE if there is at least one constraint that is violated.
 * The callback is used by primal heuristics to check a constructed solution for feasibility.
 * That means, the constraint handler has to deal with arbitrary solutions that do not necessarily satisfy the bounds
 * and constraints of the local subproblem.
 *
 * The value of a variable \em var in the given solution \em sol can be accessed by calling
 * \code
 * SCIPgetSolVal(scip, sol, var)
 * \endcode
 *
 * For example, the \ref cons_knapsack.h "knapsack constraint handler" loops over his constraints and
 * calculates the scalar product \f$w^T x\f$ of weights \f$w\f$ with the solution vector \f$x\f$.
 * This scalar product is compared with the capacity of the knapsack constraint.
 * If it exceeds the capacity, the CONSCHECK method is immediately aborted with the result SCIP_INFEASIBLE.
 * If all knapsack constraints are satisfied, a result SCIP_FEASIBLE is returned.
 *
 * @subsection CONSENFOLP
 *
 * The CONSENFOLP method is called after the price-and-cut loop was finished and an LP solution is available.
 * Like the CHECK method, the ENFOLP method should check the solution (in this case, the LP solution) for
 * feasibility.
 * However, the solution is not given as a SCIP_SOL* data structure.
 *
 * The value of a variable \em var in the LP solution can be accessed by calling
 * \code
 * SCIPgetVarSol(scip, var)
 * \endcode
 * or by
 * \code
 * SCIPgetSolVal(scip, NULL, var)
 * \endcode
 * By using the latter method, you can have a single local method to check a solution for feasibility by passing
 * the given \em sol in the CHECK call and by passing a NULL pointer as \em sol in the ENFOLP and ENFOPS calls.
 *
 * Like the CHECK call, the ENFOLP method should return a result SCIP_FEASIBLE, if the solution satisfies all the
 * constraints.
 * However, the behavior should be different, if the solution violates one or more constraints.
 * The constraint handler may return a result SCIP_INFEASIBLE in this situation, but this is not the best what
 * one can do.
 * The ENFOLP method has the possibility of \em resolving the infeasibility by
 * - stating that the current subproblem is infeasible (result SCIP_CUTOFF),
 * - adding an additional constraint that resolves the infeasibility (result SCIP_CONSADDED),
 * - reducing the domain of a variable (result SCIP_REDUCEDDOM),
 * - adding a cutting plane (result SCIP_SEPARATED),
 * - performing a branching (result SCIP_BRANCHED).
 *
 * @subsection CONSENFOPS
 *
 * The CONSENFOPS callback is similar to the CONSENFOLP callback, but deals with \em pseudo \em solutions instead
 * of LP solutions.
 *
 * If the LP was not solved at the current subproblem (either because the user did not want to solve it, or because
 * numerical difficulties in the LP solving process were detected) no LP solution is available.
 * In this situation, the pseudo solution is used instead.
 * In this solution, the variables are set to the local bound which is best with respect to the objective function.
 * You can think of the pseudo solution as solution to the LP relaxation with all constraints except the bounds
 * being removed.
 *
 * Like the ENFOLP callback, the ENFOPS callback has to check whether the pseudo solution satisfies all the constraints
 * of the constraint handler.
 * The pseudo solution can be accessed by the same methods as the LP solution (SCIP knows, if the LP was solved at the
 * current subproblem, and returns either the LP solution or the pseudo solution).
 *
 * Unlike the ENFOLP callback, the ENFOPS callback must not add cuts and cannot return the result SCIP_SEPARATED.
 * It is, however, possible to force the solving of the LP by returning the result SCIP_SOLVELP.
 * For example, the infeasibility of a linear constraint that contains continuous variables cannot be resolved,
 * if all integer variables in the constraint are already fixed.
 * In this case, the LP has to be solved in order to get a solution that satisfies the linear constraint.
 *
 * @subsection CONSLOCK
 *
 * The CONSLOCK callback provides dual information for a single constraint.
 * It has to tell SCIP, which variables are existing in the given constraint, and in which way modifications of these
 * variables may affect the feasibility of the constraint.
 *
 * For each variable that is affected by the constraint, the callback should call SCIPaddVarLocks():
 *  - If the constraint may become violated by decreasing the value of a variable, it should call
 *    SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, var, nlockspos, nlocksneg), saying that rounding down is potentially rendering the
 *    (positive) constraint infeasible and rounding up is potentially rendering the negation of the constraint
 *    infeasible.
 *  - If the constraint may become violated by increasing the value of a variable, it should call
 *    SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, var, nlocksneg, nlockspos), saying that rounding up is potentially rendering the
 *    constraint's negation infeasible and rounding up is potentially rendering the constraint itself
 *    infeasible.
 *  - If the constraint may become violated by changing the variable in any direction, it should call
 *    SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, var, nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg).
 *
 *  <b>Note:</b> You do not have to worry about nlockspos and nlocksneg. These integer values are given as
 *  parameter of the CONSLOCK callback (see type_cons.h). Just use these variables in the above described
 *  fashion <b>without</b> adding or subtracting anything to them. In case of the knapsack constraints this
 *  method looks like this.
 *
 *  \code
 *  static
 *  SCIP_DECL_CONSLOCK(consLockKnapsack)
 *  {
 *     SCIP_CONSDATA* consdata;
 *     int i;
 *
 *     consdata = SCIPconsGetData(cons);
 *     assert(consdata != NULL);
 *
 *     for( i = 0; i < consdata->nvars; i++)
 *     {
 *        SCIP_CALL( SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, consdata->vars[i], nlocksneg, nlockspos) );
 *     }
 *
 *     return SCIP_OKAY;
 *  }
 * \endcode
 *
 *  To give same more intuition, consider the linear constraint \f$3x -5y +2z \leq 7\f$ as an example.
 *  The CONSLOCK callback method of the linear constraint handler should call
 *  SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, x, nlocksneg, nlockspos), SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, y, nlockspos, nlocksneg),
 *  and SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, z, nlocksneg, nlockspos) to tell SCIP,  that rounding up of \f$x\f$
 *  and \f$z\f$ and rounding down of \f$y\f$ can destroy the feasibility of the constraint, while rounding
 *  down of \f$x\f$ and \f$z\f$ and rounding up of \f$y\f$ can destroy the feasibility of the
 *  constraint's negation \f$3x -5y +2z > 7\f$.
 *  \n
 *  A linear constraint \f$2 \leq 3x -5y +2z \leq 7\f$ should call
 *  SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, ..., nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg) on all variables,
 *  since rounding in both directions of each variable can destroy both the feasibility of the
 *  constraint and it's negation \f$3x -5y +2z < 2\f$  or  \f$3x -5y +2z > 7\f$.
 *
 *
 * @section CONS_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.  However, some of them have to be
 * implemented for most applications.
 *
 * @subsection CONSFREE
 *
 * If you are using constraint handler data, you have to implement this method in order to free the
 * constraint handler data. This can be done by the following procedure (which is taken from the
 * \ref cons_knapsack.h "knapsack constraint handler"):
 *
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_CONSFREE(consFreeKnapsack)
 * {
 *    SCIP_CONSHDLRDATA* conshdlrdata;
 *
 *    conshdlrdata = SCIPconshdlrGetData(conshdlr);
 *    assert(conshdlrdata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &conshdlrdata);
 *
 *    SCIPconshdlrSetData(conshdlr, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your constraint handler data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the constraint handler data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection CONSHDLRCOPY
 *
 * The CONSHDLRCOPY callback is executed when the SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to solve a sub-SCIP. By defining this
 * callback as <code>NULL</code> the user disables the inclusion of the specified constraint handler into all copied SCIP
 * instances. This may deteriorate the performance of primal heuristics solving sub-SCIPs, since these constitute only
 * relaxations of the original problem if constraint handlers are missing.
 *
 * A usual implementation just
 * calls the interface method which includes the constraint handler to the model. For example, this callback is
 * implemented for the knapsack constraint handler as follows:
 *
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_CONSHDLRCOPY(conshdlrCopyKnapsack)
 * {
 *    assert(scip != NULL);
 *    assert(conshdlr != NULL);
 *    assert(strcmp(SCIPconshdlrGetName(conshdlr), CONSHDLR_NAME) == 0);
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPincludeConshdlrKnapsack(scip) );
 *
 *    *valid = TRUE;
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> If you implement this callback, take care when setting the valid pointer. The valid pointer should be
 * set to TRUE if (and only if!) you can make sure that all necessary data of the constraint handler are copied
 * correctly. If the complete problem is validly copied, i.e. if the copy methods of all problem defining plugins
 * (constraint handlers and pricers) return <code>*valid = TRUE</code>, then dual reductions found for the copied problem can be
 * transferred to the original SCIP instance. Thus, if the valid pointer is wrongly set to TRUE, it might happen that
 * optimal solutions are cut off.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> If you implement this callback and the constraint handler needs constraints (see CONSHDLR_NEEDSCONS),
 * then you also need to implement the callback \ref CONSCOPY.
 *
 * @subsection CONSINIT
 *
 * The CONSINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.
 * The constraint handler may, e.g., use this call to replace the original variables in its constraints by transformed
 * variables, or to initialize his statistical constraint handler data.
 *
 * @subsection CONSEXIT
 *
 * The CONSEXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method, the constraint handler should free all resources that were allocated for the solving process.
 *
 * @subsection CONSINITPRE
 *
 * The CONSINITPRE callback is executed before the preprocessing is started, even if presolving is turned off.
 * The constraint handler may use this call to initialize its presolving data, or to modify its constraints
 * before the presolving process begins.
 * Necessary constraint modifications that have to be performed even if presolving is turned off should be done here
 * or in the presolving deinitialization call.
 *
 * @subsection CONSEXITPRE
 *
 * The CONSEXITPRE callback is executed after the preprocessing has been finished, even if presolving is turned off.
 * The constraint handler may use this call e.g. to clean up its presolving data, or to finally modify its constraints
 * before the branch-and-bound process begins.
 * Necessary constraint modifications that have to be performed even if presolving is turned off should be done here
 * or in the presolving initialization call.
 * Besides necessary modifications and clean up, no time consuming operations should be done.
 *
 * @subsection CONSINITSOL
 *
 * The CONSINITSOL callback is executed when the presolving is finished and the branch-and-bound process is about to
 * begin.
 * The constraint handler may use this call to initialize its branch-and-bound specific data.
 *
 * @subsection CONSEXITSOL
 *
 * The CONSEXITSOL callback is executed before the branch-and-bound process is freed.
 * The constraint handler should use this call to clean up its branch-and-bound data, in particular to release
 * all LP rows that it has created or captured.
 *
 * @subsection CONSDELETE
 *
 * The CONSDELETE callback is executed if a constraint should be freed.
 * You can think of it as the destructor of a single constraint.
 * In the callback, you have to free the given constraint data.
 * The CONSDELETE callback is therefore the counterpart of the SCIPcreateCons...() interface method and the CONSTRANS
 * method.
 *
 * @subsection CONSTRANS
 *
 * The CONSTRANS method is called for each constraint of the constraint handler, when the user starts the solving
 * process.
 * It has to copy the original constraint data of the constraint to the memory for the transformed problem.
 * You can think of it as a copy constructor for a single constraint.
 *
 * The original model is copied in order to protect it from transformations that are applied during the solving process,
 * in particular during preprocessing.
 * Preprocessing and solving always operates on the transformed problem.
 * If the solving process data are freed, the original data still exist and the user can, e.g., modify the problem and
 * restart the solving process.
 *
 * If you do not implement the CONSTRANS method, a transformed constraint is created with the same flags and the
 * same constraint data pointer.
 * That means, the transformed constraint points to the original constraint data.
 * This is okay, as long as the constraint data is not changed during the solving process.
 * If you want to implement preprocessing methods or other methods that modify the constraint data, you have to
 * implement the CONSTRANS method and create a copy of the constraint data.
 *
 * Here is an example, which is taken from the \ref cons_knapsack.h "knapsack constraint handler":
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_CONSTRANS(consTransKnapsack)
 * {
 *    SCIP_CONSHDLRDATA* conshdlrdata;
 *    SCIP_CONSDATA* sourcedata;
 *    SCIP_CONSDATA* targetdata;
 *
 *    assert(conshdlr != NULL);
 *    assert(strcmp(SCIPconshdlrGetName(conshdlr), CONSHDLR_NAME) == 0);
 *    assert(SCIPgetStage(scip) == SCIP_STAGE_TRANSFORMING);
 *    assert(sourcecons != NULL);
 *    assert(targetcons != NULL);
 *
 *    sourcedata = SCIPconsGetData(sourcecons);
 *    assert(sourcedata != NULL);
 *    assert(sourcedata->row == NULL);
 *
 *    conshdlrdata = SCIPconshdlrGetData(conshdlr);
 *    assert(conshdlrdata != NULL);
 *    assert(conshdlrdata->eventhdlr != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( consdataCreate(scip, &targetdata, conshdlrdata->eventhdlr,
 *          sourcedata->nvars, sourcedata->vars, sourcedata->weights, sourcedata->capacity) );
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPcreateCons(scip, targetcons, SCIPconsGetName(sourcecons), conshdlr, targetdata,
 *          SCIPconsIsInitial(sourcecons), SCIPconsIsSeparated(sourcecons), SCIPconsIsEnforced(sourcecons),
 *          SCIPconsIsChecked(sourcecons), SCIPconsIsPropagated(sourcecons),
 *          SCIPconsIsLocal(sourcecons), SCIPconsIsModifiable(sourcecons),
 *          SCIPconsIsDynamic(sourcecons), SCIPconsIsRemovable(sourcecons), SCIPconsIsStickingAtNode(sourcecons)) );
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * @subsection CONSINITLP
 *
 * The CONSINITLP callback is executed before the first LP relaxation is solved.
 * It should add the LP relaxations of all "initial" constraints to the LP. The method should scan the constraints
 * array for constraints that are marked initial via calls to SCIPconsIsInitial() and put the LP relaxation
 * of all initial constraints to the LP with calls to SCIPaddCut().
 *
 * @subsection CONSSEPALP
 *
 * The CONSSEPALP callback is executed during the price-and-cut loop of the subproblem processing.
 * It should try to generate cutting planes for the constraints of the constraint handler in order to separate
 * the current LP solution.
 * The method is called in the LP solution loop, which means that a valid LP solution exists.
 *
 * Usually, a separation callback searches and produces cuts, that are added with a call to SCIPaddCut().
 * If the cut should be remembered in the global cut pool, it may also call SCIPaddPoolCut().
 * However, the callback may also produce domain reductions or add other constraints.
 *
 * The CONSSEPALP callback has the following options:
 *  - detecting that the node is infeasible in the variables' bounds and can be cut off (result SCIP_CUTOFF)
 *  - adding an additional constraint (result SCIP_CONSADDED)
 *  - reducing a variable's domain (result SCIP_REDUCEDDOM)
 *  - adding a cutting plane to the LP (result SCIP_SEPARATED)
 *  - stating that the separator searched, but did not find domain reductions, cutting planes, or cut constraints
 *    (result SCIP_DIDNOTFIND)
 *  - stating that the separator was skipped (result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN)
 *  - stating that the separator was skipped, but should be called again (result SCIP_DELAYED)
 *  - stating that a new separation round should be started without calling the remaining separator methods (result SCIP_NEWROUND)
 *
 * @subsection CONSSEPASOL
 *
 * The CONSSEPASOL callback is executed during separation loop on arbitrary primal solutions.
 * It should try to generate cutting planes for the constraints of the constraint handler in order to separate
 * the given primal solution.
 * The method is not called in the LP solution loop, which means that there is no valid LP solution.
 *
 * Usually, a separation callback searches and produces cuts, that are added with a call to SCIPaddCut().
 * If the cut should be remembered in the global cut pool, it may also call SCIPaddPoolCut().
 * However, the callback may also produce domain reductions or add other constraints.
 *
 * The CONSSEPASOL callback has the following options:
 *  - detecting that the node is infeasible in the variables' bounds and can be cut off (result SCIP_CUTOFF)
 *  - adding an additional constraint (result SCIP_CONSADDED)
 *  - reducing a variable's domain (result SCIP_REDUCEDDOM)
 *  - adding a cutting plane to the LP (result SCIP_SEPARATED)
 *  - stating that the separator searched, but did not find domain reductions, cutting planes, or cut constraints
 *    (result SCIP_DIDNOTFIND)
 *  - stating that the separator was skipped (result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN)
 *  - stating that the separator was skipped, but should be called again (result SCIP_DELAYED)
 *  - stating that a new separation round should be started without calling the remaining separator methods (result SCIP_NEWROUND)
 *
 * @subsection CONSPROP
 *
 * The CONSPROP callback is called during the subproblem processing.
 * It should propagate the constraints, which means that it should infer reductions in the variables' local bounds
 * from the current local bounds.
 * This technique, which is the main workhorse of constraint programming, is called "node preprocessing" in the
 * Integer Programming community.
 *
 * The CONSPROP callback has the following options:
 *  - detecting that the node is infeasible in the variables' bounds and can be cut off (result SCIP_CUTOFF)
 *  - reducing a variable's domain (result SCIP_REDUCEDDOM)
 *  - stating that the propagator searched, but did not find domain reductions, cutting planes, or cut constraints
 *    (result SCIP_DIDNOTFIND)
 *  - stating that the propagator was skipped (result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN)
 *  - stating that the propagator was skipped, but should be called again (result SCIP_DELAYED)
 *
 * @subsection CONSRESPROP
 *
 * If the constraint handler should support conflict analysis, it has to supply a CONSRESPROP method.
 * It also should call SCIPinferVarLbCons() or SCIPinferVarUbCons() in domain propagation instead of SCIPchgVarLb() or
 * SCIPchgVarUb() in order to deduce bound changes on variables.
 * In the SCIPinferVarLbCons() and SCIPinferVarUbCons() calls, the handler provides the constraint that deduced the
 * variable's bound change, and an integer value "inferinfo" that can be arbitrarily chosen.
 *
 * The propagation conflict resolving method CONSRESPROP must then be implemented to provide the "reasons" for the bound
 * changes, i.e., the bounds of variables at the time of the propagation, which forced the constraint to set the
 * conflict variable's bound to its current value. It can use the "inferinfo" tag to identify its own propagation rule
 * and thus identify the "reason" bounds. The bounds that form the reason of the assignment must then be provided by
 * calls to SCIPaddConflictLb() and SCIPaddConflictUb() in the propagation conflict resolving method.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> The fact that "inferinfo" is an integer, as opposed to an arbitrary data object, is a compromise between space and speed. Sometimes a propagator would
 * need more information to efficiently infer the original propagation steps that lead to the conflict. This would,
 * however, require too much space. In the extreme, the original propagation steps have to be repeated.
 *
 * For example, the logicor constraint \f$c = x \vee y \vee z\f$ fixes variable \f$z\f$ to TRUE (i.e., changes the lower
 * bound of \f$z\f$ to 1.0), if both, \f$x\f$ and \f$y\f$, are assigned to FALSE (i.e., if the upper bounds of these
 * variables are 0.0). It uses <code>SCIPinferVarLbCons(scip, z, 1.0, c, 0)</code> to apply this assignment (an
 * inference information tag is not needed by the constraint handler and is set to 0).  In the conflict analysis, the
 * constraint handler may be asked to resolve the lower bound change on \f$z\f$ with constraint \f$c\f$, that was
 * applied at a time given by a bound change index "bdchgidx".  With a call to <code>SCIPvarGetLbAtIndex(z,
 * bdchgidx)</code>, the handler can find out, that the lower bound of variable \f$z\f$ was set to 1.0 at the given
 * point of time, and should call <code>SCIPaddConflictUb(scip, x, bdchgidx)</code> and <code>SCIPaddConflictUb(scip, y,
 * bdchgidx)</code> to tell SCIP, that the upper bounds of \f$x\f$ and \f$y\f$ at this point of time were the reason for
 * the deduction of the lower bound of \f$z\f$.
 *
 * If conflict analysis should not be supported, the method has to set the result code to SCIP_DIDNOTFIND.  Although
 * this is a viable approach to circumvent the implementation of the usually rather complex conflict resolving method, it
 * will make the conflict analysis less effective. We suggest to first omit the conflict resolving method and check how
 * effective the propagation method is. If it produces a lot of propagations for your application, you definitely should
 * consider implementing the conflict resolving method.
 *
 * @subsection CONSPRESOL
 *
 * The CONSPRESOL callback is called during preprocessing.
 * It should try to tighten the domains of the variables, tighten the coefficients of the constraints of the constraint
 * handler, delete redundant constraints, aggregate and fix variables if possible, and upgrade constraints to more
 * specific types.
 *
 * If the CONSPRESOL callback applies changes to the constraint data, you also have to implement the \ref CONSTRANS callback
 * in order to copy the constraint data to the transformed problem space and protect the original problem from the
 * preprocessing changes.
 *
 * To inform SCIP that the presolving method found a reduction the result pointer has to be set in a proper way.
 * The following options are possible:
 *
 *  - SCIP_UNBOUNDED  : at least one variable is not bounded by any constraint in objective direction
 *  - SCIP_CUTOFF     : at least one constraint is infeasible in the variable's bounds
 *  - SCIP_SUCCESS    : the presolver found a reduction
 *  - SCIP_DIDNOTFIND : the presolver searched, but did not find a presolving change
 *  - SCIP_DIDNOTRUN  : the presolver was skipped
 *  - SCIP_DELAYED    : the presolver was skipped, but should be called again
 *
 * @subsection CONSACTIVE
 *
 * The CONSACTIVE callback method is called each time a constraint of the constraint handler is activated.
 * For example, if a constraint is added locally to a subproblem, the CONSACTIVE callback is called whenever the
 * search enters the subtree where the constraint exists.
 *
 * @subsection CONSDEACTIVE
 *
 * The CONSDEACTIVE callback method is called each time a constraint of the constraint handler is deactivated.
 * For example, if a constraint is added locally to a subproblem, the CONSDEACTIVE callback is called whenever the
 * search leaves the subtree where the constraint exists.
 *
 * @subsection CONSENABLE
 *
 * The CONSENABLE callback method is called each time a constraint of the constraint handler is enabled.
 * Constraints might be active without being enabled. In this case, only the feasibility checks are executed,
 * but domain propagation and separation is skipped.
 *
 * @subsection CONSDISABLE
 *
 * The CONSDISABLE callback method is called each time a constraint of the constraint handler is disabled.
 *
 * @subsection CONSPRINT
 *
 * The CONSPRINT callback method is called, when the user asks SCIP to display the problem to the screen
 * or save the problem into a file. This is, however, only the case if the user requested the CIP format.
 * For more details about reading and writing with SCIP we refer to the \ref READER "file readers". In this
 * callback method the constraint handler should display the data of the constraint in an appropriate form.
 * The output format that is defined by the CONSPRINT callbacks is called CIP format.
 * In later versions of SCIP, the constraint handlers should also be able to parse (i.e., read) constraints
 * which are given in CIP format.
 *
 * @subsection CONSCOPY
 *
 * The CONSCOPY callback method is used if constraints should get copied from one SCIP instance into another SCIP
 * instance. This method comes with the necessary parameters to do so, most importantly with a mapping of the variables of the
 * source SCIP instance to the corresponding variables of the target SCIP instance, and a mapping for the constraints
 * in the same way. For a complete list of all arguments of this callback method see type_cons.h.
 *
 * To get the corresponding target variable of a given source variable, you can use the variable map directly:
 *
 * \code
 * targetvar = (SCIP_VAR*) (size_t) SCIPhashmapGetImage(varmap, sourcevar);
 * \endcode
 *
 * We recommend, however, to use the method SCIPgetVarCopy() which gets the variable map and the constraint map as input
 * (besides others) and returns the requested target variable. The advantage of using SCIPgetVarCopy() is, that in case
 * the required variable does not exist, yet, it is created and added to the copy automatically:
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPgetVarCopy(sourcescip, scip, sourcevar, &targetvar, varmap, consmap, global) );
 * \endcode
 *
 * Finally, the result pointer valid has to be set to TRUE if (and only if!) the copy process was successful.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> Be careful when setting the valid pointer. If you set the valid pointer to TRUE, but the constraint was
 * not copied one-to-one, then optimal solutions might be cut off during the search (see section
 * CONSHDLRCOPY above).
 *
 * For an example implementation we refer to cons_linear.h. Additional documentation and the complete list of all
 * parameters can be found in the file in type_cons.h.
 *
 * @subsection CONSPARSE
 *
 * This method is the counter part to CONSPRINT. The ideal idea is that a constraint handler is able to parse the output
 * which it generated via the CONSPRINT method and creates the corresponding constraint. If the parsing was successfully
 * the result pointer success should be set to TRUE. An example implementation can be found in the \ref cons_linear.h
 * "linear constraint handler".
 *
 * @subsection CONSDELVARS
 *
 * This method should iterate over the given constraints and delete all variables that were marked for deletion by SCIPdelVar().
 * Variable deletion is especially interesting for branch-cut-and-price applications. If your constraint handler allows
 * the addition of variables during the solving process (see "modifiable" attribute of constraints), then you might also want to
 * implement this callback. This would allow you to not only create variables during solving, but also remove them dynamically
 * from the problem to reduce memory consumption in case they are no longer necessary.
 * During presolving, SCIP may also find that some variables are not needed anymore and then try
 * to delete them. Thus, if you do not implement this callback, the constraint handler should capture its variables via
 * SCIPcaptureVar() to prevent SCIP from erroneously deleting them.
 *
 * Additional documentation and the complete list of all parameters can be found in the file type_cons.h.

/**@page PRICER How to add variable pricers
 *
 * A pricer performs the dynamic generation of new variables in a column generation algorithm.
 * It is an algorithmic representation of a (usually exponential) number of variables.
 * The \ref PRICERREDCOST and \ref PRICERFARKAS methods are called after each LP solve to generate additional
 * variables which may improve the objective value or decrease the LP infeasibility, respectively.
 * \n
 * A complete list of all pricers contained in this release can be found \ref PRICERS "here".
 *
 * If the pricer finds one or more variables with negative reduced costs or negative Farkas value, it should
 * call SCIPcreateVar() and SCIPaddPricedVar() to create and add the variable to the problem. Additionally,
 * the pricer has to add the variable to all constraints in which it appears. Therefore, a pricer needs to
 * know the constraints of the model and their meaning. Note that all constraints for which additional variables
 * are generated by a pricer have to be flagged as "modifiable" in the SCIPcreateCons() call.
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own pricers.
 * For example, look into the stable set pricer for the coloring problem (examples/Coloring/src/pricer_coloring.c) of the
 * Coloring example project.
 * The example is written in C. C++ users can easily adapt the code by using the scip::scip::ObjPricer wrapper base class and
 * implement the scip_...() virtual methods instead of the SCIP_DECL_PRICER... callback methods.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a pricer can be found in the file
 * type_pricer.h.
 *
 * Notice that if your pricer cannot cope with variable bounds other than 0 and infinity, you have to mark
 * all constraints containing priced variables as modifiable, and you may have to disable reduced cost
 * strengthening by setting propagating/rootredcost/freq to -1.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement a pricer:
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/pricer_xyz.c and src/scip/pricer_xyz.h into files "pricer_mypricer.c"
 *    and "pricer_mypricer.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "mypricer".
 * -# Adjust the properties of the pricer (see \ref PRICER_PROPERTIES).
 * -# Define the pricer data (see \ref PRICER_DATA). This is optional.
 * -# Implement the interface methods (see \ref PRICER_INTERFACE).
 * -# Implement the fundamental callback methods (see \ref PRICER_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS).
 * -# Implement the additional callback methods (see \ref PRICER_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS).  This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section PRICER_PROPERTIES Properties of a Pricer
 *
 * At the top of the new file "pricer_mypricer.c" you can find the pricer properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the pricer properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjPricer from within your constructor.
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par PRICER_NAME: the name of the pricer.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the pricer.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a pricer with SCIPfindPricer(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two pricers may have the same name.
 *
 * \par PRICER_DESC: the description of the pricer.
 * This string is printed as a description of the pricer in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par PRICER_PRIORITY: the priority of the pricer.
 * In each pricing round during the price-and-cut loop of the subproblem processing, the included pricers are
 * called in a predefined order, which is given by the priorities of the pricers.
 * The higher the priority, the earlier the pricer is called.
 * Usually, you will have only one pricer in your application and the priority is therefore irrelevant.
 *
 * \par PRICER_DELAY: the default for whether the pricer should be delayed, if other variables with negative reduced costs have already been found in the current pricing round.
 * Variables may be declared to be "removable" in the SCIPcreateVar() call. This means that SCIP may remove the variable
 * from the LP if it was inactive (i.e., sitting at zero) for a number of LP solves. Nevertheless, after the removal of the
 * column from the LP, the variable still exists, and SCIP can calculate reduced costs and add it to the LP again if
 * necessary.
 * \n
 * If the PRICER_DELAY flag is set to TRUE (which is the common setting), all those existing variables with negative reduced costs
 * are added to the LP, and the LP is resolved before the pricer is called. Thus, the pricer can assume that all existing variables
 * have non-negative reduced costs if the \ref PRICERREDCOST or \ref PRICERFARKAS methods are called.
 * \n
 * In some applications, this inner pricing loop on the already existing variables can significantly slow down the solving process,
 * since it may lead to the addition of only very few variables in each pricing round. If this is an issue in your application,
 * you should consider setting the PRICER_DELAY flag to FALSE. You must, however, be aware of the fact that there may be already
 * existing variables with negative reduced costs. For example, this may lead to the issue that your pricer generates the same
 * variable twice. In some models, this is not critical because an optimal solution would choose only one of the two identical
 * variables anyway, but for other models this can lead to wrong results because the duplication of a variable essentially doubles
 * the upper bound of the variable.
 *
 *
 * @section PRICER_DATA Pricer Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_PricerData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your pricer. For example, it may be convenient to store pointers to the
 * constraints of the problem instance here, because the pricer has to add variables to those constraints.
 * If you are using C++, you can add pricer data, as usual, as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining pricer data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section PRICER_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "pricer_mypricer.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludePricerMypricer(), which also appears in "pricer_mypricer.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the pricer by calling the method
 * SCIPincludePricer().
 * It is called by the user, if he wants to include the pricer, i.e., if he wants to solve a model for which variables should
 * be generated by this pricer. In addition, the pricer has to be activated before the solution process starts, like it is done
 * in the reader of the Coloring example (examples/Coloring/src/reader_col.c) by calling
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPactivatePricer(scip, SCIPfindPricer(scip, "coloring")) );
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you are using pricer data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &pricerdata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_PricerData afterwards.
 *
 * You may also add user parameters for your pricer, see the method SCIPincludePricerColoring() in the pricer of the Coloring example
 * for an example of how to add user parameters.
 *
 *
 * @section PRICER_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a Pricer
 *
 * The fundamental callback methods have to be implemented in order to obtain an operational algorithm.
 * In the case of a pricer, there is only one fundamental callback method, namely the PRICERREDCOST method
 * which searches and adds new variables to the problem.
 * This method has to be implemented for every pricer; the other callback methods are optional.
 * In the C++ wrapper class scip::ObjPricer, the scip_redcost() method (which corresponds to the PRICERREDCOST callback)
 * is a virtual abstract member function. You have to implement it in order to be able to construct an object of your
 * pricer class.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_pricer.h.
 *
 * @subsection PRICERREDCOST
 *
 * The PRICERREDCOST callback is called inside the price-and-cut loop of the subproblem solving process if the current LP relaxation
 * is feasible.
 * It should search for additional variables that can contribute to improve the current LP's solution value.
 * In standard branch-and-price, these are variables with negative dual feasibility, that is negative
 * reduced costs for non-negative variables, positive reduced costs for non-positive variables,
 * and non-zero reduced costs for variables that can be negative and positive.
 *
 * Whenever the pricer finds a variable with negative dual feasibility, it should call SCIPcreateVar()
 * and SCIPaddPricedVar() to add the variable to the problem. Furthermore, it should call the appropriate
 * methods of the constraint handlers to add the necessary variable entries to the constraints.
 *
 * In the usual case that the pricer either adds a new variable or ensures that there are no further variables with negative dual feasibility,
 * the result pointer should be set to SCIP_SUCCESS. Only if the pricer aborts pricing without creating a new variable, but
 * there might exist additional variables with negative dual feasibility, the result pointer should be set to SCIP_DIDNOTRUN.
 * In this case, which sometimes is referred to as "early branching", the lp solution will not be used as a lower bound.
 * The pricer can, however, store a valid lower bound in the lowerbound pointer.
 *
 * Pricers usually need the dual LP solution as input for the pricing algorithm.
 * Since SCIP does not know the semantics of the individual constraints in the problem, the dual solution
 * has to be provided by the constraint handlers.
 * For example, the setppc constraint handler that deals with set partitioning, packing, and covering constraints provides
 * the method SCIPgetDualsolSetppc() (defined in cons_setppc.h) to access the dual solution value for a single constraint.
 * Similarly, the dual solution of a linear constraint can be queried with the method SCIPgetDualsolLinear() of cons_linear.h.
 * The reduced costs of the existing variables can be accessed with the method SCIPgetVarRedcost().
 *
 *
 * @section PRICER_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Pricer
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.
 * However, some of them have to be implemented for most applications.
 *
 *
 * @subsection PRICERFARKAS
 *
 * If the current LP relaxation is infeasible, it is the task of the pricer to generate additional variables that can
 * potentially render the LP feasible again. In standard branch-and-price, these are variables with positive Farkas values,
 * and the PRICERFARKAS method should identify those variables.
 *
 * If the LP was proven to be infeasible, we have an infeasibility proof by the dual Farkas multipliers \f$y\f$.
 * With the values of \f$y\f$, an implicit inequality \f$y^T A x \ge y^T b\f$ is associated, with \f$b\f$ given
 * by the sides of the LP rows and the sign of \f$y\f$:
 *  - if \f$y_i\f$ is positive, \f$b_i\f$ is the left hand side of the row,
 *  - if \f$y_i\f$ is negative, \f$b_i\f$ is the right hand side of the row.
 *
 * \f$y\f$ is chosen in a way, such that the valid inequality  \f$y^T A x \ge y^T b\f$  is violated by all \f$x\f$,
 * especially by the (for this inequality least infeasible solution) \f$x'\f$ defined by
 *  - \f$x'_i := ub_i\f$, if \f$y^T A_i \ge 0\f$
 *  - \f$x'_i := lb_i\f$, if \f$y^T A_i < 0\f$.
 * Pricing in this case means to add variables \f$i\f$ with positive Farkas value, i.e., \f$y^T A_i x'_i > 0\f$.
 *
 * To apply Farkas pricing, the pricer needs to know the Farkas values of the constraints. Like the dual solution values for
 * feasible LP solutions, the dual Farkas values for infeasible solutions can be obtained by constraint handler interface
 * methods such as the SCIPgetDualfarkasLinear() method of the linear constraint handler.
 * The Farkas values for the bounds of the variables are just the regular reduced costs and can be accessed with SCIPgetVarRedcost().
 *
 * It is useful to note that Farkas pricing is the same as the regular pricing with a zero objective function.
 * Therefore, a typical implementation of a pricer would consist of a generic pricing algorithm that gets a dual solution and an
 * objective function vector as input and generates variables by calling SCIPcreateVar() and SCIPaddPricedVar().
 * The PRICERREDCOST callback would call this function with the regular objective function and the regular dual solution vector,
 * while the PRICERFARKAS callback would call this function with a zero objective function and the Farkas vector.
 * From a practical point of view, it is usually the simplest approach to provide just one Boolean flag to the generic pricing
 * algorithm in order to identify whether it is reduced cost or Farkas pricing. Then, the algorithm would just call the appropriate
 * methods to access the dual solution or objective function, depending on the Boolean flag.
 *
 * @subsection PRICERFREE
 *
 * If you are using pricer data, you have to implement this method in order to free the pricer data.
 * This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_PRICERFREE(pricerFreeMypricer)
 * {
 *    SCIP_PRICERDATA* pricerdata;
 *
 *    pricerdata = SCIPpricerGetData(pricer);
 *    assert(pricerdata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &pricerdata);
 *
 *    SCIPpricerSetData(pricer, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your pricer data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the pricer data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection PRICERCOPY
 *
 * The PRICERCOPY callback is executed when the SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to solve a sub-SCIP. By defining this
 * callback as <code>NULL</code> the user disables the inclusion of the pricer into all copied SCIP
 * instances. This means that primal heuristics will work on a sub-SCIP that contains only a part of the variables
 * and no variables are priced in during the solving process of the sub-SCIP. Therefore, primal solutions found in the
 * copied problem are typically still valid for the original problem and used for its solving process,
 * but dual reductions cannot be transferred to the original problem.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> If you implement this callback, be careful when setting the valid pointer. The valid pointer should be
 * set to TRUE if (and only if!) you can make sure that all necessary data of the pricer are copied
 * correctly. If the complete problem is validly copied, i.e. if the copy methods of all problem defining plugins
 * (constraint handlers and pricers) return <code>*valid = TRUE</code>, then dual reductions found for the copied problem can be
 * transferred to the original SCIP instance. Thus, if the valid pointer is wrongly set to TRUE, it might happen that
 * optimal solutions are cut off.
 *
 * @subsection PRICERINIT
 *
 * The PRICERINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.
 * The pricer may, e.g., use this call to replace the original constraints stored in its pricer data by transformed
 * constraints, or to initialize other elements of his pricer data.
 *
 * @subsection PRICEREXIT
 *
 * The PRICEREXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method the pricer should free all resources that have been allocated for the solving process in PRICERINIT.
 *
 * @subsection PRICERINITSOL
 *
 * The PRICERINITSOL callback is executed when the presolving is finished and the branch-and-bound process is about to begin.
 * The pricer may use this call to initialize its branch-and-bound specific data.
 *
 * @subsection PRICEREXITSOL
 *
 * The PRICEREXITSOL callback is executed before the branch-and-bound process is freed.
 * The pricer should use this call to clean up its branch-and-bound data, which was allocated in PRICERINITSOL.
 *
 * @section PRICER_REMARKS Further remarks
 *
 * If you use your own branching rule (e.g., to branch on constraints), make sure that it is able to branch on pseudo solutions.
 * Otherwise, SCIP will use its default branching rules, if necessary (which all branch on variables). This
 * could disturb the pricing problem or branching might not even be possible, e.g., if all variables created thus far have already been fixed.
 *
 * Note that if the original problem is a maximization problem, SCIP will transform the problem into a minimization
 * problem by multiplying the objective function by -1. The pricer has to consider this and thus, the original
 * objective function value of all variables created during the solving process should also be multiplied by -1.
 *
 * In some cases, bounds on variables are implicitly enforced by constraints of the problem and the objective function.
 * Therefore, these bounds do not need to be added to the LP explicitly, which has the advantage that the pricing routine does not need to
 * care about the corresponding dual values.
 * We call these bounds lazy bounds, they may be set by SCIPchgVarLbLazy() and SCIPchgVarUbLazy() for upper or lower bounds, respectively.
 * If the lazy bound is tighter than the local bound, the corresponding bound is not put into the LP.
 * In diving mode, lazy bounds are explicitly put into the LP, because changing the objective (which is possible only in diving)
 * might reverse the implicitly given bounds. When diving is finished, the bounds are again removed from the LP.

/**@page PRESOL How to add presolvers
 *
 * Presolvers are used to reduce the size of the model by removing irrelevant information like redundant constraints,
 * to strengthen the LP relaxation by exploiting integrality information, and to extract useful information in the
 * presolving step.
 * Constraint based presolving is done in the CONSPRESOL callback methods of the constraint handlers, see \ref CONSPRESOL.
 * The presolver plugins complement the constraint based presolving by additional, usually optimality based, presolving
 * reductions.
 * \n
 * A complete list of all presolvers contained in this release can be found \ref PRESOLVERS "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own presolvers.
 * Take the dual fixing presolver (src/scip/presol_dualfix.c) as an example.
 * As all other default plugins, it is written in C. C++ users can easily adapt the code by using the scip::ObjPresol wrapper
 * base class and implement the scip_...() virtual methods instead of the SCIP_DECL_PRESOL... callback methods.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a presolver, in particular for their input parameters,
 * can be found in the file type_presol.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement a presolver:
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/presol_xyz.c and src/scip/presol_xyz.h into files named "presol_mypresolver.c"
 *    and "presol_mypresolver.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "mypresolver".
 * -# Adjust the properties of the presolver (see \ref PRESOL_PROPERTIES).
 * -# Define the presolver data (see \ref PRESOL_DATA). This is optional.
 * -# Implement the interface methods (see \ref PRESOL_INTERFACE).
 * -# Implement the fundamental callback methods (see \ref PRESOL_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS).
 * -# Implement the additional callback methods (see \ref PRESOL_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS). This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section PRESOL_PROPERTIES Properties of a Presolver
 *
 * At the top of the new file "presol_mypresolver.c", you can find the presolver properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the presolver properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjPresol from within your constructor.
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par PRESOL_NAME: the name of the presolver.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the presolver.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a presolver with SCIPfindPresol(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two presolvers may have the same name.
 *
 * \par PRESOL_DESC: the description of the presolver.
 * This string is printed as a description of the presolver in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par PRESOL_PRIORITY: the priority of the presolver.
 * In each presolving round, the presolvers and presolving methods of the constraint handlers are called in
 * a predefined order, which is given by the priorities of the presolvers and the check priorities of the
 * constraint handlers, see \ref CONS_PROPERTIES.
 * First, the presolvers with non-negative priority are called in the order of decreasing priority.
 * Next, the presolving methods of the different constraint handlers are called in the order of decreasing check
 * priority.
 * Finally, the presolvers with negative priority are called in the order of decreasing priority.
 * \n
 * The priority of the presolver should be set according to the complexity of the presolving algorithm and the impact of the reduction:
 * presolvers that provide fast algorithms that usually have a high impact (i.e., remove lots of variables or tighten
 * bounds of many variables) should have a high priority. An easy way to list the
 * priorities of all presolvers and constraint handlers is to type "display presolvers" and "display conshdlrs" in
 * the interactive shell of SCIP.
 *
 * \par PRESOL_MAXROUNDS: the default maximal number of rounds the presolver participates in.
 * The presolving is conducted in rounds: the presolvers and presolving methods of the constraint handlers
 * are called iteratively until no more reductions have been found or some other abort criterion applies.
 * The "maxrounds" parameter of a presolver imposes a limit on the number of presolving rounds in which the
 * presolver is called. The PRESOL_MAXROUNDS property specifies the default value for this parameter.
 * A value of -1 represents an unlimited number of rounds.
 *
 * \par PRESOL_DELAY: the default for whether the presolver should be delayed, if other presolvers found reductions.
 * If the presolver is marked to be delayed, it is only executed if no other presolvers found a reduction during the current
 * presolving round.
 * If the presolver is very expensive, you may want to mark it to be delayed until all cheap presolving methods have been executed.
 *
 *
 * @section PRESOL_DATA Presolver Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_PresolData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your presolver. For example, you should store the adjustable parameters
 * of the presolver in this data structure.
 * If you are using C++, you can add presolver data as usual as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining presolver data is optional. You can leave this struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section PRESOL_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "presol_mypresolver.c", you can find the interface method SCIPincludePresolMypresolver(),
 * which also appears in "presol_mypresolver.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the presolver by calling the method
 * SCIPincludePresol().
 * SCIPincludePresolMypresolver() is called by the user, if he wants to include the presolver,
 * i.e., if he wants to use the presolver in his application.
 *
 * If you are using presolver data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &presoldata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_PresolData afterwards. For freeing the
 * presolver data, see \ref PRESOLFREE.
 *
 * You may also add user parameters for your presolver, see \ref PARAM for how to add user parameters and
 * the method SCIPincludePresolTrivial() in src/scip/presol_trivial.c for an example.
 *
 *
 * @section PRESOL_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a Presolver
 *
 * The fundamental callback methods of the plugins are the ones that have to be implemented in order to obtain
 * an operational algorithm. Presolver plugins have only one fundamental callback method, namely the PRESOLEXEC method.
 * This method has to be implemented for every presolver; the other callback methods are optional.
 * In the C++ wrapper class scip::ObjPresol, the scip_exec() method (which corresponds to the PRESOLEXEC callback) is a virtual
 * abstract member function.
 * You have to implement it in order to be able to construct an object of your presolver class.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods, in particular to their input parameters,
 * can be found in type_presol.h.
 *
 * @subsection PRESOLEXEC
 *
 * The PRESOLEXEC callback is called inside the presolving loop and should perform the actual presolving reductions.
 * It should inspect the problem instance at hand and simplify it by tightening bounds of variables, aggregating or fixing
 * variables, changing the type of variables, modifying the graph that represents the instance of your application, and
 * the like.
 *
 * Typical methods called by a presolver are, for example, SCIPchgVarType(), SCIPfixVar(), SCIPaggregateVars(), SCIPtightenVarLb(),
 * and SCIPtightenVarUb().
 *
 *
 * @section PRESOL_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Presolver
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.
 * They can be used, for example, to initialize and free private data.
 *
 * @subsection PRESOLFREE
 *
 * If you are using presolver data (see \ref PRESOL_DATA and \ref PRESOL_INTERFACE), you have to implement this method in order to free the presolver data.
 * This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_PRESOLFREE(presolFreeMypresolver)
 * {
 *    SCIP_PRESOLDATA* presoldata;
 *
 *    presoldata = SCIPpresolGetData(presol);
 *    assert(presoldata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &presoldata);
 *
 *    SCIPpresolSetData(presol, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your presolver data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the presolver data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection PRESOLINIT
 *
 * The PRESOLINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.
 * The presolver may, e.g., use this call to initialize its presolver data.
 * The difference between the original and the transformed problem is explained in
 * "What is this thing with the original and the transformed problem about?" on \ref FAQ.
 *
 * @subsection PRESOLCOPY
 *
 * The PRESOLCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to
 * solve a sub-SCIP. By
 * defining this callback as
 * <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified
 * presolver for all copied SCIP instances. This may deteriorate the performance
 * of primal heuristics using sub-SCIPs.
 *
 * @subsection PRESOLEXIT
 *
 * The PRESOLEXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method, the presolver should free all resources that have been allocated for the solving process in PRESOLINIT.
 *
 * @subsection PRESOLINITPRE
 *
 * The PRESOLINITPRE callback is executed when the presolving is about to begin.
 * The presolver may use this call to initialize its presolving data which only need to exist during the presolving stage.
 *
 * @subsection PRESOLEXITPRE
 *
 * The PRESOLEXITPRE callback is executed after presolving finishes and before the branch-and-bound process begins.
 * The presolver should use this call to clean up its presolving data, which was allocated in PRESOLINITPRE.

/**@page SEPA How to add separators
 *
 * Separators are used to generate general purpose cutting planes.
 * Constraint based cutting planes, the second type of cutting planes in SCIP, are separated in the CONSSEPALP and
 * CONSSEPASOL callback methods of the constraint handlers, see \ref CONSSEPALP and \ref CONSSEPASOL. These cuts are
 * valid inequalities or even facets of the polyhedron described by a single constraint or a subset of the constraints of
 * a single constraint class. In contrast, general purpose cuts do not require or exploit any knowledge about the
 * underlying problem structure but use only the current LP relaxation and the integrality conditions. See also
 * "When should I implement a constraint handler, when should I implement a separator?" on \ref FAQ.
 * \n
 * A complete list of all separators contained in this release can be found \ref SEPARATORS "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own separators.
 * Take the separator for the class of Gomory mixed integer inequalities (src/scip/sepa_gomory.c) as an example.
 * As all other default plugins, it is written in C. C++ users can easily adapt the code by using the scip::ObjSepa wrapper
 * base class and implement the scip_...() virtual methods instead of the SCIP_DECL_SEPA... callback methods.

 *
 *
 * @section SEPA_PROPERTIES Properties of a Separator
 *
 * At the top of the new file "sepa_myseparator.c", you can find the separator properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the separator properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjSepa from within your constructor.

 *
 * \par SEPA_NAME: the name of the separator.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the separator.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a separator with SCIPfindSepa(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two separators may have the same name.
 *
 * \par SEPA_DESC: the description of the separator.
 * This string is printed as a description of the separator in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par SEPA_PRIORITY: the priority of the separator.
 * In each separation round during the price-and-cut loop of the subproblem processing or the separation loop
 * of the primal solution separation, the separators and separation methods of the constraint handlers are called in
 * a predefined order, which is given by the priorities of the separators and the separation priorities
 * of the constraint handlers (see \ref CONS_PROPERTIES).
 * First, the separators with non-negative priority are called in the order of decreasing priority.
 * Next, the separation methods of the constraint handlers are called in the order of decreasing separation
 * priority.
 * Finally, the separators with negative priority are called in the order of decreasing priority. An easy way to list the
 * priorities of all separators and constraint handlers is to type "display separators" and "display conshdlrs" in
 * the interactive shell.
 * \n
 * The priority of the separator should be set according to the complexity of the cut separation algorithm and the
 * impact of the resulting cuts: separators that provide fast algorithms that usually have a high impact (i.e., cut off
 * a large portion of the LP relaxation) should have a high priority.
 * See \ref SEPAEXECLP and \ref SEPAEXECSOL for further details of the separation callbacks.
 *
 * \par SEPA_FREQ: the default frequency for separating cuts.
 * The frequency defines the depth levels at which the separation methods \ref SEPAEXECLP and \ref SEPAEXECSOL are called.
 * For example, a frequency of 7 means, that the separation callback is executed for subproblems that are in depth
 * 0, 7, 14, ... of the branching tree. A frequency of 0 means, that the separation method is only called at the root node.
 * A frequency of -1 disables the separator.
 * \n
 * The frequency can be adjusted by the user. This property of the separator only defines the default value of the frequency.
 * If you want to have a more flexible control of when to execute the separation algorithm, you have to assign
 * a frequency of 1 and implement a check at the beginning of your separation methods whether you really want to execute
 * the separation or not. If you do not want to execute it, set the result code of
 * \ref SEPAEXECLP and \ref SEPAEXECSOL to SCIP_DIDNOTRUN.
 *
 * \par SEPA_MAXBOUNDDIST: the default maximal relative distance from the current node's dual bound to primal bound compared to best node's dual bound for applying separation.
 * At the current branch-and-bound node, the relative distance from its dual bound (local dual bound)
 * to the primal bound compared to the best node's dual bound (global dual bound) is considered. The separation method
 * of the separator will only be applied at the current node if this relative distance does not exceed SEPA_MAXBOUNDDIST.
 * \n
 * For example, if the global dual bound is 50 and the primal bound is 60, SEPA_MAXBOUNDDIST = 0.25 means that separation
 * is only applied if the current node's dual bound is in the first quarter of the interval [50,60], i.e., if it is less
 * than or equal to 52.5.
 * \n
 * In particular, the values 0.0 and 1.0 mean that separation is applied at the current best node only or at all
 * nodes, respectively. Since separation seems to be most important to apply at nodes that define to the global
 * dual bound, 0.0 is probably a good choice for SEPA_MAXBOUNDDIST.
 * Note that separators with a frequency of SEPA_FREQ = 0 are only applied at the root node.
 * Obviously, at the root node the local dual bound is equal to the global dual bound and thus, the separator is called
 * for any value of SEPA_MAXBOUNDDIST.
 *
 * \par SEPA_USESSUBSCIP: Does the separator use a secondary SCIP instance?
 * Some heuristics and separators solve MIPs or SAT problems and use a secondary SCIP instance. Examples are
 * Large Neighborhood Search heuristics such as RINS and Local Branching or the CGMIP separator. To avoid recursion,
 * these plugins usually deactivate all other plugins that solve MIPs. If a separator uses a secondary SCIP instance,
 * this parameter has to be TRUE and it is recommended to call SCIPsetSubscipsOff() for the secondary SCIP instance.
 *
 * \par SEPA_DELAY: the default for whether the separation method should be delayed, if other separators or constraint handlers found cuts.
 * If the separator's separation method is marked to be delayed, it is only executed after no other separator
 * or constraint handler found a cut during the price-and-cut loop.
 * If the separation method of the separator is very expensive, you may want to mark it to be delayed until all cheap
 * separation methods have been executed.
 *
 * @section SEPA_DATA Separator Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_SepaData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your separator. For example, you should store the adjustable
 * parameters of the separator in this data structure. In a separator, user parameters for the maximal number of
 * separation rounds per node and for the maximal number of cuts separated per separation round might be useful.
 * If you are using C++, you can add separator data as usual as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining separator data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 * @section SEPA_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "sepa_myseparator.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludeSepaMyseparator(), which also
 * appears in "sepa_myseparator.h".

 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.

 * SCIPincludeSepaMyseparator() is called by the user, if he wants to include the separator, i.e., if he wants to use

 *
 * The fundamental callback methods of the plugins are the ones that have to be implemented in order to obtain

 * callback methods are optional. However, you probably want to at least use the optional callback \ref SEPAEXECLP
 * to separate LP solutions.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods, in particular to their input parameters,
 * can be found in type_sepa.h.
 *
 * @section SEPA_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Separator
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.
 * They can be used, for example, to initialize and free private data.
 * The main functions of separators are the \ref SEPAEXECLP and \ref SEPAEXECSOL callbacks.
 *
 * @subsection SEPAEXECLP
 *
 * The SEPAEXECLP callback is executed during the price-and-cut loop of the subproblem processing.
 * It should try to generate general purpose cutting planes in order to separate the current LP solution.
 * The method is called in the LP solution loop, which means that a valid LP solution exists.
 *
 * Usually, the callback searches and produces cuts, that are added with a call to SCIPaddCut().
 * If the cut should be added to the global cut pool, it calls SCIPaddPoolCut().
 * In addition to LP rows, the callback may also produce domain reductions or add additional constraints.
 *
 * Overall, the SEPAEXECLP callback has the following options, which is indicated by the possible return values of
 * the 'result' variable (see type_sepa.h):
 *  - detecting that the node is infeasible in the variable's bounds and can be cut off (result SCIP_CUTOFF)
 *  - adding an additional constraint (result SCIP_CONSADDED)
 *  - reducing a variable's domain (result SCIP_REDUCEDDOM)
 *  - adding a cutting plane to the LP (result SCIP_SEPARATED)
 *  - stating that the separator searched, but did not find domain reductions, cutting planes, or cut constraints
 *    (result SCIP_DIDNOTFIND)
 *  - stating that the separator was skipped (result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN)
 *  - stating that the separator was skipped, but should be called again (result SCIP_DELAYED)
 *  - stating that a new separation round should be started without calling the remaining separator methods (result SCIP_NEWROUND)
 *
 * @subsection SEPAEXECSOL
 *
 * The SEPAEXECSOL callback is executed during the separation loop on arbitrary primal solutions.
 * It should try to generate general purpose cutting planes in order to separate the given primal solution.
 * The method is not called in the LP solution loop, which means that there is no valid LP solution.
 *
 * In the standard SCIP environment, the SEPAEXECSOL callback is not used because only LP solutions are
 * separated. The SEPAEXECSOL callback provides means to support external relaxation handlers like semidefinite
 * relaxations that want to separate an intermediate primal solution vector. Thus, if you do not want to support
 * such external plugins, you do not need to implement this callback method.
 *
 * Usually, the callback searches and produces cuts, that are added with a call to SCIPaddCut().
 * If the cut should be added to the global cut pool, it calls SCIPaddPoolCut().
 * In addition to LP rows, the callback may also produce domain reductions or add other constraints.
 *
 * Overall, the SEPAEXECSOL callback has the following options, which is indicated by the possible return values of
 * the 'result' variable (see type_sepa.h):
 *  - detecting that the node is infeasible in the variable's bounds and can be cut off (result SCIP_CUTOFF)
 *  - adding an additional constraint (result SCIP_CONSADDED)
 *  - reducing a variable's domain (result SCIP_REDUCEDDOM)
 *  - adding a cutting plane to the LP (result SCIP_SEPARATED)

 *    (result SCIP_DIDNOTFIND)
 *  - stating that the separator was skipped (result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN)
 *  - stating that the separator was skipped, but should be called again (result SCIP_DELAYED)
 *  - stating that a new separation round should be started without calling the remaining separator methods (result SCIP_NEWROUND)
 *
 * @subsection SEPAFREE
 *
 * If you are using separator data (see \ref SEPA_DATA and \ref SEPA_INTERFACE), you have to implement this method
 * in order to free the separator data. This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_SEPAFREE(sepaFreeMyseparator)
 * {
 *    SCIP_SEPADATA* sepadata;
 *
 *    sepadata = SCIPsepaGetData(sepa);

 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &sepadata);
 *
 *    SCIPsepaSetData(sepa, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your separator data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the separator data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection SEPACOPY
 *
 * The SEPACOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to
 * solve a sub-SCIP. By
 * defining this callback as
 * <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified
 * separator for all copied SCIP instances. This may deteriorate the performance
 * of primal heuristics using sub-SCIPs.

 * @subsection SEPAINIT
 *
 * The SEPAINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.
 * The separator may, e.g., use this call to initialize its separator data.
 * The difference between the original and the transformed problem is explained in
 * "What is this thing with the original and the transformed problem about?" on \ref FAQ.
 *
 * @subsection SEPAEXIT
 *
 * The SEPAEXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method, the separator should free all resources that have been allocated for the solving process in SEPAINIT.
 *
 * @subsection SEPAINITSOL
 *
 * The SEPAINITSOL callback is executed when the presolving is finished and the branch-and-bound process is about to
 * begin. The separator may use this call to initialize its branch-and-bound specific data.
 *
 * @subsection SEPAEXITSOL
 *
 * The SEPAEXITSOL callback is executed before the branch-and-bound process is freed. The separator should use this call
 * to clean up its branch-and-bound data, in particular to release all LP rows that it has created or captured.

/**@page PROP How to add propagators
 *
 * Propagators are used to tighten the domains of the variables. Like for cutting planes, there are two different types
 * of domain propagations. Constraint based (primal) domain propagation algorithms are part of the corresponding
 * constraint handlers, see \ref CONSPROP. In contrast, domain propagators usually provide dual propagations, i.e.,
 * propagations that can be applied using the objective function and the current best known primal solution. This
 * section deals with such propagators.
 *
 * A complete list of all propagators contained in this release can be found \ref PROPAGATORS "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own propagators.  Take the pseudo objective function propagator
 * (src/scip/prop_pseudoobj.c) as an example.  As all other default plugins, it is written in C. C++ users can easily
 * adapt the code by using the scip::ObjProp wrapper base class and implement the @c scip_...() virtual methods instead
 * of the @c SCIP_DECL_PROP... callback methods.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a propagator can be found in the file type_prop.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement a propagator:
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/prop_xyz.c and src/scip/prop_xyz.h into files named "prop_mypropagator.c"
 *    and "prop_mypropagator.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "mypropagator".
 * -# Adjust the properties of the propagator (see \ref PROP_PROPERTIES).
 * -# Define the propagator data (see \ref PROP_DATA). This is optional.
 * -# Implement the interface methods (see \ref PROP_INTERFACE).
 * -# Implement the fundamental callback methods (see \ref PROP_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS).
 * -# Implement the additional callback methods (see \ref PROP_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS). This is optional.
 *
 * @section PROP_PROPERTIES Properties of a Propagator
 *
 * At the top of the new file "prop_mypropagator.c" you can find the propagator properties. These are given as compiler
 * defines.  In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the propagator properties by calling the constructor of the
 * abstract base class scip::ObjProp from within your constructor.  The properties you have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par PROP_NAME: the name of the propagator.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the propagator.  Additionally, if you are searching for a
 * propagator with SCIPfindProp(), this name is searched for.  Names have to be unique: no two propagators may have the
 * same name.
 *
 * \par PROP_DESC: the description of the propagator.
 * This string is printed as a description of the propagator in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par PROP_PRIORITY: the priority of the propagator.
 * In each propagation round, the propagators and propagation methods of the constraint handlers are called in a
 * predefined order, which is given by the priorities of the propagators and the check priorities of the constraint
 * handlers.  First, the propagators with non-negative priority are called in order of decreasing priority.  Next, the
 * propagation methods of the different constraint handlers are called in order of decreasing check priority.  Finally,
 * the propagators with negative priority are called in order of decreasing priority.  \n The priority of the
 * propagators should be set according to the complexity of the propagation algorithm and the impact of the domain
 * propagations: propagators providing fast algorithms that usually have a high impact (i.e., tighten many bounds)
 * should have a high priority.
 *
 * \par PROP_FREQ: the default frequency for propagating domains.
 * The frequency defines the depth levels at which the propagation method \ref PROPEXEC is called.  For example, a
 * frequency of 7 means, that the propagation callback is executed for subproblems that are in depth 0, 7, 14, ... of
 * the branching tree. A frequency of 0 means that propagation is only applied in preprocessing and at the root node. A
 * frequency of -1 disables the propagator.
 * \n
 * The frequency can be adjusted by the user. This property of the propagator only defines the default value of the
 * frequency.\n
 * <b>Note:</b> If you want to have a more flexible control of when to execute the propagation algorithm, you have to
 * assign a frequency of 1 and implement a check at the beginning of your propagation algorithm whether you really want
 * to execute the domain propagation or not. If you do not want to execute it, set the result code to SCIP_DIDNOTRUN.
 *
 * \par PROP_DELAY: the default for whether the propagation method should be delayed, if other propagators or constraint handlers found domain reductions.
 * If the propagator's propagation method is marked to be delayed, it is only executed after no other propagator or
 * constraint handler found a domain reduction in the current iteration of the domain propagation loop.  If the
 * propagation method of the propagator is very expensive, you may want to mark it to be delayed until all cheap
 * propagation methods have been executed.
 *
 * \par PROP_TIMING: the timing mask of the propagator.
 * SCIP calls the domain propagation routines at different places in the node processing loop.
 * This property indicates at which places the propagator is called.
 * Possible values are defined in type_timing.h and can be concatenated, e.g., as in SCIP_PROPTIMING_ALWAYS.
 *
 * \par PROP_PRESOL_PRIORITY: the priority of the presolving method.
 * This attribute is analogous to the PROP_PRIORITY flag, but deals with the preprocessing method of the presolver.
 *
 * \par PROP_PRESOL_MAXROUNDS: the default maximal number of presolving rounds the propagator participates in.
 * The preprocessing is executed in rounds.
 * If enough changes have been applied to the model, an additional preprocessing round is performed.
 * The MAXROUNDS parameter of a propagator denotes the maximal number of preprocessing rounds, the propagator
 * participates in.
 * A value of -1 means, that there is no limit on the number of rounds.
 * A value of 0 means, the preprocessing callback of the propagator is disabled.
 *
 * \par PROP_PRESOL_DELAY: the default for whether the presolving method should be delayed, if other propagators or constraint handlers found presolving reductions.
 * This property is analogous to the PROP_DELAY flag, but deals with the preprocessing method of the propagator.
 *
 * @section PROP_DATA Propagator Data
 *
 * Below the title "Data structures" you can find a struct called <code>struct SCIP_PropData</code>.  In this data
 * structure, you can store the data of your propagator. For example, you should store the adjustable parameters of the
 * propagator in this data structure.  If you are using C++, you can add propagator data as object variables to your
 * class as usual .
 * \n
 * Defining propagator data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section PROP_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "prop_mypropagator.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludePropMypropagator(), which also
 * appears in "prop_mypropagator.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.  It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the propagator
 * by calling the method SCIPincludeProp(). It is called by the user, if he wants to include the propagator, i.e., if he
 * wants to use the propagator in his application.
 *
 * If you are using propagator data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.  You can do this by
 * calling
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &propdata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in <code>struct SCIP_PropData</code> afterwards.
 *
 * You may also add user parameters for your propagator, see the method SCIPincludePropPseudoobj() in
 * src/scip/prop_pseudoobj.c for an example.
 *
 *
 * @section PROP_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a Propagator
 *
 * Propagator plugins have two fundamental callback methods, namely the \ref PROPEXEC method and the \ref PROPRESPROP
 * method.  These methods have to be implemented for every propagator; the other callback methods are optional.  In the
 * C++ wrapper class scip::ObjProp, the scip_exec() method and the scip_resprop() method (which correspond to the \ref
 * PROPEXEC callback and \ref PROPRESPROP callback, respectively) are virtual abstract member functions. You have to
 * implement them in order to be able to construct an object of your propagator class.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_prop.h.
 *
 * @subsection PROPEXEC
 *
 * The PROPEXEC callback is called during presolving and during the subproblem processing. It should perform the actual
 * domain propagation, which means that it should tighten the variables' bounds.  The technique of domain propagation,
 * which is the main workhorse of constraint programming, is called "node preprocessing" in the Integer Programming
 * community.
 *
 * The PROPEXEC callback has the following options:
 *  - detecting that the node is infeasible in the variables' bounds and can be cut off (result SCIP_CUTOFF)
 *  - reducing (i.e, tightening) the domains of some variables (result SCIP_REDUCEDDOM)
 *  - stating that the propagator searched, but did not find domain reductions, cutting planes, or cut constraints
 *    (result SCIP_DIDNOTFIND)
 *  - stating that the propagator was skipped (result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN)
 *  - stating that the propagator was skipped, but should be called again (result SCIP_DELAYED)
 *
 * @subsection PROPRESPROP
 *
 * If the propagator wants to support conflict analysis, it has to supply the PROPRESPROP method.  It also should call
 * SCIPinferVarLbProp() or SCIPinferVarUbProp() in the domain propagation instead of SCIPchgVarLb() or SCIPchgVarUb() in
 * order to deduce bound changes on variables.  In the SCIPinferVarLbProp() and SCIPinferVarUbProp() calls, the
 * propagator provides a pointer to itself and an integer value "inferinfo" that can be arbitrarily chosen.
 *
 * The propagation conflict resolving method PROPRESPROP must then be implemented to provide the "reasons" for the bound
 * changes, i.e., the bounds of variables at the time of the propagation, which forced the propagator to set the
 * conflict variable's bound to its current value. It can use the "inferinfo" tag to identify its own propagation rule
 * and thus identify the "reason" bounds. The bounds that form the reason of the assignment must then be provided by
 * calls to SCIPaddConflictLb() and SCIPaddConflictUb() in the propagation conflict resolving method.
 *
 * See the description of the propagation conflict resolving method \ref CONSRESPROP of constraint handlers for
 * further details.
 *
 * If conflict analysis should not be supported, the method has to set the result code to SCIP_DIDNOTFIND.  Although
 * this is viable approach to circumvent the implementation of the usually rather complex conflict resolving method, it
 * will make the conflict analysis less effective. We suggest to first omit the conflict resolving method and check how
 * effective the propagation method is. If it produces a lot of propagations for your application, you definitely should
 * consider implementing the conflict resolving method.
 *
 *
 * @section PROP_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Propagator
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not have to be implemented in every case.  They can be used, for example, to
 * initialize and free private data.
 *
 * @subsection PROPFREE
 *
 * If you are using propagator data, you have to implement this method in order to free the propagator data.
 * This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_PROPFREE(propFreeMypropagator)
 * {
 *    SCIP_PROPDATA* propdata;
 *
 *    propdata = SCIPpropGetData(prop);
 *    assert(propdata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &propdata);
 *
 *    SCIPpropSetData(prop, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your propagator data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the propagator data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection PROPINIT
 *
 * The PROPINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.  The propagator may, e.g., use this call to
 * initialize its propagator data.
 *
 * @subsection PROPCOPY
 *
 * The PROPCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to
 * solve a sub-SCIP. By
 * defining this callback as
 * <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified
 * propagator for all copied SCIP instances. This may deteriorate the performance
 * of primal heuristics using sub-SCIPs.
 *
 * @subsection PROPEXIT
 *
 * The PROPEXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method, the propagator should free all resources that have been allocated for the solving process in PROPINIT.
 *
 * @subsection PROPINITPRE
 *
 * The PROPINITPRE callback is executed before the preprocessing is started, even if presolving is turned off.
 * The propagator may use this call to initialize its presolving data before the presolving process begins.
 *
 * @subsection PROPEXITPRE
 *
 * The PROPEXITPRE callback is executed after the preprocessing has been finished, even if presolving is turned off.
 * The propagator may use this call, e.g., to clean up its presolving data.
 * Besides clean up, no time consuming operations should be done.
 *
 * @subsection PROPINITSOL
 *
 * The PROPINITSOL callback is executed when the presolving is finished and the branch-and-bound process is about to
 * begin.
 * The propagator may use this call to initialize its branch-and-bound specific data.
 *
 * @subsection PROPEXITSOL
 *
 * The PROPEXITSOL callback is executed before the branch-and-bound process is freed.
 * The propagator should use this call to clean up its branch-and-bound data.
 *
 * @subsection PROPPRESOL
 *
 * Seaches for domain propagations, analogous to the \ref PROPEXEC callback.
 * However, this callback is called during preprocessing.
 *
 * To inform SCIP that the presolving method found a reduction the result pointer has to be set in a proper way.
 * The following options are possible:
 *
 *  - SCIP_UNBOUNDED  : at least one variable is not bounded by any constraint in objective direction
 *  - SCIP_CUTOFF     : at least one domain reduction that renders the problem infeasible has been found
 *  - SCIP_SUCCESS    : the presolver found a domain reduction
 *  - SCIP_DIDNOTFIND : the presolver searched, but did not find a presolving change
 *  - SCIP_DIDNOTRUN  : the presolver was skipped
 *  - SCIP_DELAYED    : the presolver was skipped, but should be called again
 *

/**@page BRANCH How to add branching rules
 *
 * Branching rules are used to split the problem at the current node into smaller subproblems. Branching rules can be called at three
 * different occasions, which is why they have three different execution methods (see \ref
 * BRANCHRULE_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS).  Branching is performed if:
 * - the LP solution of the current problem is fractional. In this case, the integrality constraint handler calls the
 *   \ref BRANCHEXECLP methods of the branching rules.
 * - the list of external branching candidates is not empty. This will only be the case if branching candidates were added
 *   by a user's \ref RELAX "relaxation handler" or \ref CONS "constraint handler" plugin, calling SCIPaddExternBranchCand().
 *   These branching candidates should be processed by the \ref BRANCHEXECEXT method.
 * - if an integral solution violates one or more constraints and this infeasibility could not be resolved in the callback methods
 *   \ref CONSENFOLP and \ref CONSENFOPS of the corresponding constraint handlers. In this case, the \ref BRANCHEXECPS method will be called. This is the
 *   standard case, if you use SCIP as a pure CP or SAT solver. If the LP or any other type of relaxation is used, then
 *   branching on pseudo solutions works as a last resort.
 *
 * The idea of branching rules is to take a global view on the problem. In contrast, branching paradigms which are
 * specific to one type of constraint are best implemented within the enforcement callbacks of your constraint handler.
 * See, e.g., the constraint specific branching rules provided by the constraint handlers for special ordered sets
 * (src/scip/cons_sos{1,2}.c)).
 * \n
 * All branching rules that come with the default distribution of SCIP create two subproblems by splitting a single
 * variable's domain.  It is, however, fully supported to implement much more general branching schemes, for example by
 * creating more than two subproblems, or by adding additional constraints to the subproblems instead of tightening the
 * domains of the variables.
 * \n
 * A complete list of all branching rules contained in this release can be found \ref BRANCHINGRULES "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own branching rules.  Take the most infeasible LP branching rule
 * (src/scip/branch_mostinf.c) as an example.  As all other default plugins, it is written in C. C++ users can easily
 * adapt the code by using the scip::ObjBranchrule wrapper base class and implement the scip_...() virtual methods instead of
 * the SCIP_DECL_BRANCH... callback methods.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a branching rule can be found in the file type_branch.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement a branching rule:
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/branch_xyz.c and src/scip/branch_xyz.h into files named
 *    "branch_mybranchingrule.c" and "branch_mybranchingrule.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "mybranchingrule".
 * -# Adjust the properties of the branching rule (see \ref BRANCHRULE_PROPERTIES).
 * -# Define the branching rule data (see \ref BRANCHRULE_DATA). This is optional.
 * -# Implement the interface methods (see \ref BRANCHRULE_INTERFACE).
 * -# Implement the fundamental callback methods (see \ref BRANCHRULE_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS).
 * -# Implement the additional callback methods (see \ref BRANCHRULE_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS). This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section BRANCHRULE_PROPERTIES Properties of a Branching Rule
 *
 * At the top of the new file "branch_mybranchingrule.c" you can find the branching rule properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the branching rule properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjBranchrule from within your constructor.
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par BRANCHRULE_NAME: the name of the branching rule.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the branching rule.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a branching rule with SCIPfindBranchrule(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two branching rules may have the same name.
 *
 * \par BRANCHRULE_DESC: the description of the branching rule.
 * This string is printed as a description of the branching rule in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par BRANCHRULE_PRIORITY: the default value for the priority of the branching rule.
 * In the subproblem processing, the branching rules are called in decreasing order of their priority until
 * one succeeded to branch. Since most branching rules are able to generate a branching in all situations,
 * only the rule of highest priority is used. In combination with the BRANCHRULE_MAXDEPTH and
 * BRANCHRULE_MAXBOUNDDIST settings, however, interesting strategies can be easily employed. For example,
 * the user can set the priority of the "full strong branching" strategy to the highest value and assign the
 * second highest value to the "reliable pseudo cost" rule. If he also sets the maximal depth for the
 * "full strong branching" to 5, in the top 5 depth levels of the search tree the "full strong branching" is
 * applied, while in the deeper levels "reliable pseudo cost branching" is used.
 * \n
 * Note that the BRANCHRULE_PRIORITY property only specifies the default value of the priority. The user can
 * change this value arbitrarily.
 *
 * \par BRANCHRULE_MAXDEPTH: the default value for the maximal depth level of the branching rule.
 * This parameter denotes the maximal depth level in the branch-and-bound tree up to which the branching method of the
 * branching rule will be applied. Use -1 for no limit.
 * \n
 * Note that this property only specifies the default value. The user can change this value arbitrarily.
 *
 * \par BRANCHRULE_MAXBOUNDDIST: the default value for the maximal relative distance from current node's dual bound to primal bound compared to best node's dual bound for applying branching.
 * At the current branch-and-bound node, the relative distance from its dual bound (local dual bound)
 * to the primal bound compared to the best node's dual bound (global dual bound) is considered. The branching method of
 * the branching rule will only be applied at the node if this relative distance does not exceed BRANCHRULE_MAXBOUNDDIST.
 * \n
 * For example, if the global dual bound is 50 and the primal bound is 60, BRANCHRULE_MAXBOUNDDIST = 0.25 means that
 * branching is only applied if the current node's dual bound is in the first quarter of the interval [50,60], i.e., if it
 * is less than or equal to 52.5. In particular, the values 0.0 and 1.0 mean that the branching rule is applied at the
 * current best node only or at all nodes, respectively.
 * \n
 * Note that the BRANCHRULE_MAXBOUNDDIST property only specifies the default value of the maximal bound distance.
 * The user can change this value arbitrarily.
 *
 *
 * @section BRANCHRULE_DATA Branching Rule Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_BranchruleData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your branching rule. For example, you should store the adjustable
 * parameters of the branching rule in this data structure.
 * If you are using C++, you can add branching rule data as usual as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining branching rule data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section BRANCHRULE_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "branch_mybranchingrule.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludeBranchruleMybranchingrule(),
 * which also appears in "branch_mybranchingrule.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the branching rule by calling the method
 * SCIPincludeBranchrule().
 * It is called by the user, if he wants to include the branching rule, i.e., if he wants to use the branching rule in his
 * application.
 *
 * If you are using branching rule data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &branchruledata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_BranchruleData afterwards.
 *
 * You may also add user parameters for your branching rule, see the method SCIPincludeBranchruleRelpscost() in
 * src/scip/branch_relpscost.c for an example.
 *
 *
 * @section BRANCHRULE_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a Branching Rule
 *
 * Branching rules do not have any fundamental callback methods, i.e., all callback methods are optional.
 * In most cases, however, you want to implement the \ref BRANCHEXECLP method and sometimes the \ref BRANCHEXECPS method.
 *
 *
 * @section BRANCHRULE_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Branching Rule
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.  They can be used, for example, to
 * initialize and free private data.  The most important callback methods are the \ref BRANCHEXECLP, \ref BRANCHEXECEXT,
 * and \ref BRANCHEXECPS methods, which perform the actual task of generating a branching.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_branch.h.
 *
 * @subsection BRANCHEXECLP
 *
 * The BRANCHEXECLP callback is executed during node processing if a fractional LP solution is available. It should
 * split the current problem into smaller subproblems. Usually, the branching is done in a way such that the current
 * fractional LP solution is no longer feasible in the relaxation of the subproblems.  It is, however, possible to
 * create a child node for which the fractional LP solution is still feasible in the relaxation, for example, by
 * branching on a variable with integral LP value.  In every case, you have to make sure that each subproblem is a
 * proper restriction of the current problem.  Otherwise, you risk to produce an infinite path in the search tree.
 *
 * The user gains access to the branching candidates, i.e., to the fractional variables, and their LP solution values by
 * calling the method SCIPgetLPBranchCands(). Furthermore, SCIP provides two methods for performing the actual
 * branching, namely SCIPbranchVar() and SCIPcreateChild().
 *
 * Given an integral variable \f$x\f$ with fractional LP solution value \f$x^*\f$, the method SCIPbranchVar() creates
 * two child nodes; one contains the bound \f$x \le \lfloor x^* \rfloor\f$ and the other one contains the bound \f$x \ge
 * \lceil x^* \rceil\f$, see the BRANCHEXECLP callback in src/scip/branch_mostinf.c for an example. In addition, if a
 * proven lower objective bound of a created child node is known, like after strong branching has been applied, the user
 * may call the method SCIPupdateNodeLowerbound() in order to update the child node's lower bound.
 *
 * Please also see the \ref BRANCHEXEC "further information for the three execution methods".
 *
 * @subsection BRANCHEXECEXT
 *
 * The BRANCHEXECEXT callback is executed during node processing if no LP solution is available and the list of
 * external branching candidates is not empty. It should split the current problem into smaller subproblems. If you
 * do not use relaxation handlers or constraints handlers that provide external branching candidates, you do not need to
 * implement this callback.
 *
 * In contrast to the LP branching candidates and the pseudo branching candidates, the list of external branching
 * candidates will not be generated automatically. The user has to add all variables to the list by calling
 * SCIPaddExternBranchCand() for each of them. Usually, this will happen in the execution method of a relaxation handler or in the
 * enforcement methods of a constraint handler.
 *
 * The user gains access to these branching candidates by calling the method SCIPgetExternBranchCands(). Furthermore,
 * SCIP provides two methods for performing the actual branching with a given solution value, namely SCIPbranchVarVal()
 * and SCIPcreateChild(). SCIPbranchVarVal() allows users to specify the branching point for a variable in contrast to
 * SCIPbranchVar(), which will always use the current LP or pseudo solution.
 *
 * This paragraph contains additional information regarding how the method SCIPbranchVarVal() works. For external branching candidates,
 * there are three principle possibilities:
 * - Given a continuous variable \f$x\f$ with solution value \f$x^*\f$, the method SCIPbranchVarVal() creates
 *   two child nodes; one contains the bound \f$x \le x^* \f$ and the other one contains the bound \f$x \ge x^* \f$.
 * - Given an integer variable \f$x\f$ with fractional solution value \f$x^*\f$, the method
 *   SCIPbranchVarVal() creates two child nodes; one contains the bound \f$x \le \lfloor x^* \rfloor\f$ and the other
 *   one contains the bound \f$x \ge \lceil x^* \rceil\f$.
 * - Given an integer variable \f$x\f$ with integral solution value \f$x^*\f$, the method SCIPbranchVarVal()
 *   creates three child nodes; one contains the bound \f$x \le x^* -1\f$, one contains the bound \f$x \ge x^* +1\f$,
 *   one contains the fixing \f$x = x^*\f$.
 *
 * See the BRANCHEXECEXT callback in src/scip/branch_random.c for an example. In addition, if a proven lower bound of a
 * created child node is known the user may call the method SCIPupdateNodeLowerbound() in order to update the child
 * node's lower bound.
 *
 * Please also see the \ref BRANCHEXEC "further information for the three execution methods".
 *
 * @subsection BRANCHEXECPS
 *
 * The BRANCHEXECPS callback is executed during node processing if no LP solution is available and at least one of the
 * integer variables is not yet fixed. It should split the current problem into smaller subproblems. PS stands for
 * pseudo solution which is the vector of all variables set to their locally best (w.r.t. the objective function)
 * bounds.
 *
 * The user gains access to the branching candidates, i.e., to the non-fixed integer variables, by calling the method
 * SCIPgetPseudoBranchCands(). Furthermore, SCIP provides two methods for performing the actual branching, namely
 * SCIPbranchVar() and SCIPcreateChild().
 *
 * Given an integer variable \f$x\f$ with bounds \f$[l,u]\f$ and not having solved the LP, the method SCIPbranchVar()
 * creates two child nodes:
 * - If both bounds are finite, then the two children will contain the domain reductions \f$x \le x^*\f$, and \f$x \ge
 *   x^*+1\f$ with \f$x^* = \lfloor \frac{l + u}{2}\rfloor\f$. The current pseudo solution will remain feasible in one
 *   of the branches, but the hope is that halving the domain's size leads to good propagations.
 * - If only one of the bounds is finite, the variable will be fixed to that bound in one of the child nodes. In the
 *   other child node, the bound will be shifted by one.
 * - If both bounds are infinite, three children will be created: \f$x \le 1\f$, \f$x \ge 1\f$, and \f$x = 0\f$.

 *
 * See the BRANCHEXECPS callback in src/scip/branch_random.c for an example. In addition, if a proven lower bound of a
 * created child node is known, the user may call the method SCIPupdateNodeLowerbound() in order to update the child
 * node's lower bound.
 *
 * Please also see the \ref BRANCHEXEC "further information for the three execution methods".
 *
 * @subsection BRANCHEXEC Further information for the three execution methods
 *
 * In order to apply more general branching schemes, one should use the method SCIPcreateChild().
 * After having created a child node, the additional restrictions of the child node have to be added with calls to
 * SCIPaddConsNode(), SCIPchgVarLbNode(), or SCIPchgVarUbNode().
 * \n
 * In the method SCIPcreateChild(), the branching rule has to assign two values to the new nodes: a node selection
 * priority for each node and an estimate for the objective value of the best feasible solution contained in the subtree
 * after applying the branching. If the method SCIPbranchVar() is used, these values are automatically assigned. For
 * variable based branching schemes, one might use the methods SCIPcalcNodeselPriority() and the method
 * SCIPcalcChildEstimate().
 *
 * In some cases, the branching rule can tighten the current subproblem instead of producing a branching. For example,
 * strong branching might have proven that rounding up a variable would lead to an infeasible LP relaxation and thus,
 * the variable must be rounded down. Therefore, the BRANCHEXECLP, BRANCHEXECPS and BRANCHEXECREL callbacks may also
 * produce domain reductions or add additional constraints to the current subproblem.
 *
 * The execution callbacks have the following options:
 *  - detecting that the node is infeasible and can be cut off (result SCIP_CUTOFF)
 *  - adding an additional constraint (e.g. a conflict constraint) (result SCIP_CONSADDED; note that this action
 *    must not be performed if the input "allowaddcons" is FALSE)
 *  - reducing the domain of a variable such that the current LP solution becomes infeasible (result SCIP_REDUCEDDOM)
 *  - applying a branching (result SCIP_BRANCHED)
 *  - stating that the branching rule was skipped (result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN).
 *
 * Only the BRANCHEXECLP callback has the possibility to add a cutting plane to the LP (result SCIP_SEPARATED).
 *
 * @subsection BRANCHFREE
 *
 * If you are using branching rule data, you have to implement this method in order to free the branching rule data.
 * This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_BRANCHFREE(branchFreeMybranchingrule)
 * {
 *    SCIP_BRANCHRULEDATA* branchruledata;
 *
 *    branchruledata = SCIPbranchruleGetData(branchrule);
 *    assert(branchruledata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &branchruledata);
 *
 *    SCIPbranchruleSetData(branchrule, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your branching rule data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the branching rule data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection BRANCHINIT
 *
 * The BRANCHINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.
 * The branching rule may, e.g., use this call to initialize its branching rule data.
 *
 * @subsection BRANCHCOPY
 *
 * The BRANCHCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to
 * solve a sub-SCIP. By
 * defining this callback as
 * <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified
 * branching rule for all copied SCIP instances. This may deteriorate the performance
 * of primal heuristics using sub-SCIPs.
 *
 * @subsection BRANCHEXIT
 *
 * The BRANCHEXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method, the branching rule should free all resources that have been allocated for the solving process in
 * BRANCHINIT.
 *

/**@page NODESEL How to add node selectors
 *
 * Node selectors are used to decide which of the leaves in the current branching tree is selected as next subproblem
 * to be processed. The ordering relation of the tree's leaves for storing them in the leaf priority queue is also
 * defined by the node selectors.
 * \n
 * A complete list of all node selectors contained in this release can be found \ref NODESELECTORS "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own node selectors.
 * Take the node selector for depth first search (src/scip/nodesel_dfs.c) as an example.
 * As all other default plugins, it is written in C. C++ users can easily adapt the code by using the scip::ObjNodesel wrapper
 * base class and implement the scip_...() virtual methods instead of the SCIP_DECL_NODESEL... callback methods.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a node selector can be found in the file type_nodesel.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement a node selector:
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/nodesel_xyz.c and src/scip/nodesel_xyz.h into files named "nodesel_mynodeselector.c"
 *    and "nodesel_mynodeselector.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "mynodeselector".
 * -# Adjust the properties of the node selector (see \ref NODESEL_PROPERTIES).
 * -# Define the node selector data (see \ref NODESEL_DATA). This is optional.
 * -# Implement the interface methods (see \ref NODESEL_INTERFACE).
 * -# Implement the fundamental callback methods (see \ref NODESEL_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS).
 * -# Implement the additional callback methods (see \ref NODESEL_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS). This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section NODESEL_PROPERTIES Properties of a Node Selector
 *
 * At the top of the new file "nodesel_mynodeselector.c" you can find the node selector properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the node selector properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjNodesel from within your constructor.
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par NODESEL_NAME: the name of the node selector.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the node selector.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a node selector with SCIPfindNodesel(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two node selectors may have the same name.
 *
 * \par NODESEL_DESC: the description of the node selector.
 * This string is printed as a description of the node selector in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par NODESEL_STDPRIORITY: the default priority of the node selector in the standard mode.
 * The first step of each iteration of the main solving loop is the selection of the next subproblem to be processed.
 * The node selector of highest priority (the active node selector) is called to do this selection.
 * In particular, if you implemented your own node selector plugin which you want to be applied, you should choose a priority
 * which is greater then all priorities of the SCIP default node selectors.
 * Note that SCIP has two different operation modes: the standard mode and the memory saving mode. If the memory
 * limit - given as a parameter by the user - is almost reached, SCIP switches from the standard mode to the memory saving
 * mode in which different priorities for the node selectors are applied. NODESEL_STDPRIORITY is the priority of the
 * node selector used in the standard mode.
 * \n
 * Note that this property only defines the default value of the priority. The user may change this value arbitrarily by
 * adjusting the corresponding parameter setting.
 *
 * \par NODESEL_MEMSAVEPRIORITY: the default priority of the node selector in the memory saving mode.
 * The priority NODESEL_MEMSAVEPRIORITY of the node selector has the same meaning as the priority NODESEL_STDPRIORITY, but
 * is used in the memory saving mode.
 * Usually, you want the best performing node selector, for example best estimate search, to have maximal
 * standard priority, while you want a node selector which tends to keep the growth of the search tree limited, for example
 * depth first search, to have maximal memory saving priority.
 * \n
 * Note that this property only defines the default value of the priority. The user may change this value arbitrarily by
 * adjusting the corresponding parameter setting.
 *
 *
 * @section NODESEL_DATA Node Selector Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_NodeselData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your node selector. For example, you should store the adjustable
 * parameters of the node selector in this data structure.
 * If you are using C++, you can add node selector data as usual as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining node selector data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section NODESEL_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "nodesel_mynodeselector.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludeNodeselMynodeselector(),
 * which also appears in "nodesel_mynodeselector.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the node selector by calling the method
 * SCIPincludeNodesel().
 * It is called by the user, if he wants to include the node selector, i.e., if he wants to use the node selector in
 * his application.
 *
 * If you are using node selector data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &nodeseldata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_NodeselData afterwards.
 *
 * You may also add user parameters for your node selector, see the method SCIPincludeNodeselRestartdfs() in
 * src/scip/nodesel_restartdfs.c for an example.
 *
 *
 * @section NODESEL_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a Node Selector
 *
 * Node selector plugins have two fundamental callback methods, namely the NODESELSELECT method and the NODESELCOMP method.
 * These methods have to be implemented for every node selector; the other callback methods are optional.
 * They implement the two requirements every node selector has to fulfill: Selecting a node from the queue to be processed
 * next and, given two nodes, deciding which of both is favored by the node selector's selection rule. The first
 * task is implemented in the NODESELSELECT callback, the second one in the NODESELCOMP callback.
 * In the C++ wrapper class scip::ObjNodesel, the scip_select() method and the scip_comp() method (which correspond to the
 * NODESELSELECT callback and the NODESELCOMP callback, respectively) are virtual abstract member functions.
 * You have to implement them in order to be able to construct an object of your node selector class.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_nodesel.h.
 *
 * @subsection NODESELSELECT
 *
 * The NODESELSELECT callback is the first method called in each iteration in the main solving loop. It should decide
 * which of the leaves in the current branching tree is selected as the next subproblem to be processed.
 * It can arbitrarily decide between all leaves stored in the tree, but for performance reasons,
 * the current node's children and siblings are often treated different from the remaining leaves.
 * This is mainly due to the warm start capabilities of the simplex algorithm and the expectation that the bases of
 * neighboring vertices in the branching tree very similar.
 * The node selector's choice of the next node to process can
 * have a large impact on the solver's performance, because it influences the finding of feasible solutions and the
 * development of the global dual bound.
 *
 * Besides the ranking of the node selector, every node gets assigned a node selection priority by the branching rule
 * that created the node. See the \ref BRANCHEXECLP and \ref BRANCHEXECPS callbacks of the branching rules for details.
 * For example, the node where the branching went in the same way as the deviation from the branching variable's
 * root solution could be assigned a higher priority than the node where the branching went in the opposite direction.
 *
 * The following methods provide access to the various types of leaf nodes:
 * - SCIPgetPrioChild() returns the child of the current node with the largest node selection priority, as assigned by the
 *   branching rule.
 *   If no child is available (for example, because the current node was pruned), a NULL pointer is returned.
 * - SCIPgetBestChild() returns the best child of the current node with respect to the node selector's ordering relation as
 *   defined by the \ref NODESELCOMP callback. If no child is available, a NULL pointer is returned.
 * - SCIPgetPrioSibling() returns the sibling of the current node with the largest node selection priority.
 *   If no sibling is available (for example, because all siblings of the current node have already been processed), a NULL
 *   pointer is returned.
 *   Note that in binary branching every node has at most one sibling, but since SCIP supports arbitrary branching rules,
 *   this might not always be the case.
 * - SCIPgetBestSibling() returns the best sibling of the current node with respect to the node selector's ordering relation
 *   as defined by the \ref NODESELCOMP callback. If no sibling is available, a NULL pointer is returned.
 * - SCIPgetBestNode() returns the best leaf from the tree (children, siblings, or other leaves) with respect to the node
 *   selector's ordering relation as defined by the \ref NODESELCOMP callback. If no open leaf exists, a NULL pointer is
 *   returned. In this case, the optimization is finished, and the node selector should return a NULL pointer as 'selnode'.
 * - SCIPgetBestboundNode() returns a leaf from the tree (children, siblings, or other leaves) with the smallest lower (dual)
 *   objective bound. If the queue is empty, a NULL pointer is returned. In this case, the optimization is finished, and the
 *   node selector should return a NULL pointer as 'selnode'.
 *
 *
 * @subsection NODESELCOMP
 *
 * The NODESELCOMP callback is called to compare two leaves of the current branching tree (say node 1 and node 2)
 * regarding their ordering relation.
 *
 * The NODESELCOMP should return the following values:
 *  - value < 0, if node 1 comes before (is better than) node 2
 *  - value = 0, if both nodes are equally good
 *  - value > 0, if node 1 comes after (is worse than) node 2.
 *
 * @section NODESEL_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Node Selector
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.
 * They can be used, for example, to initialize and free private data.
 *
 * @subsection NODESELFREE
 *
 * If you are using node selector data, you have to implement this method in order to free the node selector data.
 * This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_NODESELFREE(nodeselFreeMynodeselector)
 * {
 *    SCIP_NODESELDATA* nodeseldata;
 *
 *    nodeseldata = SCIPnodeselGetData(nodesel);
 *    assert(nodeseldata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &nodeseldata);
 *
 *    SCIPnodeselSetData(nodesel, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your node selector data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the node selector data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection NODESELINIT
 *
 * The NODESELINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.
 * The node selector may, e.g., use this call to initialize its node selector data.
 *
 * @subsection NODESELCOPY
 *
 * The NODESELCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to
 * solve a sub-SCIP. By
 * defining this callback as
 * <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified
 * node selector for all copied SCIP instances. This may deteriorate the performance
 * of primal heuristics using sub-SCIPs.
 *
 * @subsection NODESELEXIT
 *
 * The NODESELEXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method, the node selector should free all resources that have been allocated for the solving process
 * in NODESELINIT.
 *
 * @subsection NODESELINITSOL
 *
 * The NODESELINITSOL callback is executed when the presolving is finished and the branch-and-bound process is about to
 * begin.
 * The node selector may use this call to initialize its branch-and-bound specific data.
 *
 * @subsection NODESELEXITSOL
 *
 * The NODESELEXITSOL callback is executed before the branch-and-bound process is freed.
 * The node selector should use this call to clean up its branch-and-bound data.

/**@page HEUR How to add primal heuristics
 *
 * Feasible solutions can be found in two different ways during the traversal of the branch-and-bound tree. On one
 * hand, the solution of a node's relaxation may be feasible with respect to the constraints (including the integrality).
 * On the other hand, feasible solutions can be discovered by primal heuristics.
 * \n
 * A complete list of all primal heuristics contained in this release can be found \ref PRIMALHEURISTICS "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own primal heuristics.
 * Take the simple and fast LP rounding heuristic (src/scip/heur_simplerounding.c) as an example.
 * The idea of simple rounding is to iterate over all fractional variables of an LP solution and round them down,
 * if the variables appears only with nonnegative coefficients in the system Ax <= b and round them up if
 * the variables appears only with nonpositive coefficients.
 * If one of both conditions applies for each of the fractional variables, this will give a feasible solution.
 * As all other default plugins, it is written in C. C++ users can easily adapt the code by using the scip::ObjHeur wrapper
 * base class and implement the scip_...() virtual methods instead of the SCIP_DECL_HEUR... callback methods.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a primal heuristic can be found in the file type_heur.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement a primal heuristic:
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/heur_xyz.c and src/scip/heur_xyz.h into files named "heur_myheuristic.c"
 *    and "heur_myheuristic.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "myheuristic".
 * -# Adjust the properties of the primal heuristic (see \ref HEUR_PROPERTIES).
 * -# Define the primal heuristic data (see \ref HEUR_DATA). This is optional.
 * -# Implement the interface methods (see \ref HEUR_INTERFACE).
 * -# Implement the fundamental callback methods (see \ref HEUR_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS).
 * -# Implement the additional callback methods (see \ref HEUR_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS). This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section HEUR_PROPERTIES Properties of a Primal Heuristic
 *
 * At the top of the new file "heur_myheuristic.c" you can find the primal heuristic properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the primal heuristic properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjHeur from within your constructor.
 * Of course, all of them are of relevant, but the most important ones for controlling the performance
 * are usually HEUR_FREQ and HEUR_TIMING.
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par HEUR_NAME: the name of the primal heuristic.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the primal heuristic.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a primal heuristic with SCIPfindHeur(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two primal heuristics may have the same name.
 *
 * \par HEUR_DESC: the description of the primal heuristic.
 * This string is printed as a description of the primal heuristic in the interactive shell when you call "display heuristics".
 *
 * \par HEUR_DISPCHAR: the display character of the primal heuristic.
 * In the interactive shell, this character is printed in the first column of a status information row, if the primal
 * heuristic found the feasible solution belonging to the primal bound. Note that a star '*' stands for an integral
 * LP-relaxation.
 * In order to avoid confusion, display characters should be unique: no two primal heuristics should have the same display character.
 * You can get a list of all primal heuristics along with their display characters by entering "display heuristics" in the
 * SCIP interactive shell.
 *
 * \par HEUR_PRIORITY: the priority of the primal heuristic.
 * At each of the different entry points of the primal heuristics during the solving process (see HEUR_TIMING), they are
 * called in decreasing order of their priority.
 * \n
 * The priority of a primal heuristic should be set according to the complexity of the heuristic and the likelihood to find
 * feasible solutions: primal heuristics that provide fast algorithms that often succeed in finding a feasible solution should have
 * a high priority (like simple rounding). In addition, the interaction between different types of primal heuristics should be taken into account.
 * For example, improvement heuristics, which try to generate improved solutions by inspecting one or more of the feasible
 * solutions that have already been found, should have a low priority (like Crossover which by default needs at least 3 feasible solutions).
 *
 * \par HEUR_FREQ: the default frequency for executing the primal heuristic.
 * The frequency together with the frequency offset (see HEUR_FREQOFS) defines the depth levels at which the execution
 * method of the primal heuristic \ref HEUREXEC is called. For example, a frequency of 7 together with a frequency offset
 * of 5 means, that the \ref HEUREXEC callback is executed for subproblems that are in depth 5, 12, 19, ... of the branching tree. A
 * frequency of 0 together with a frequency offset of 3 means, that the execution method is only called at those nodes that are in
 * depth level 3 (i.e., at most for \f$2^3 = 8\f$ nodes if binary branching is applied).
 * Typical cases are: A frequency of 0 and an offset of 0 which means that
 * the heuristic is only called at the root node and a frequency of -1 which disables the heuristic.
 * \n
 * The frequency can be adjusted by the user. This property of the primal heuristic only defines the default value of the
 * frequency. If you want to have a more flexible control of when to execute the primal heuristic, you have to assign
 * a frequency of 1 and implement a check at the beginning of your execution method whether you really want to search for feasible
 * solutions or not. If you do not want to execute the method, set the result code to SCIP_DIDNOTRUN.
 *
 * \par HEUR_FREQOFS: the frequency offset for executing the primal heuristic.
 * The frequency offset defines the depth of the branching tree at which the primal heuristic is executed for the first
 * time. For example, a frequency of 7 (see HEUR_FREQ) together with a frequency offset of 10 means, that the
 * callback is executed for subproblems that are in depth 10, 17, 24, ... of the branching tree. In particular, assigning
 * different offset values to heuristics of the same type, like diving heuristics, can be useful for evenly spreading the
 * application of these heuristics across the branch-and-bound tree.
 * Note that if the frequency is equal to 1, the heuristic is applied for all nodes with depth level larger or equal to
 * the frequency offset.
 *
 * \par HEUR_MAXDEPTH: the maximal depth level for executing the primal heuristic.
 * This parameter denotes the maximal depth level in the branching tree up to which the execution method of the primal
 * heuristic is called. Use -1 for no limit (a usual case).
 *
 * \par HEUR_TIMING: the execution timing of the primal heuristic.
 * Primal heuristics have different entry points during the solving process and the execution timing parameter defines the
 * entry point at which the primal heuristic is executed first.
 * \n
 * The primal heuristic can be called first:
 * - before the processing of the node starts (SCIP_HEURTIMING_BEFORENODE)
 * - after each LP solve during the cut-and-price loop (SCIP_HEURTIMING_DURINGLPLOOP)
 * - after the cut-and-price loop was finished (SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERLPLOOP)
 * - after the processing of a node <em>with solved LP</em>  was finished (SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERLPNODE)
 * - after the processing of a node <em>without solved LP</em> was finished (SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERPSEUDONODE)
 * - after the processing of the last node in the current plunge was finished, <em>and only if the LP was solved for
 *   this node</em> (SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERLPPLUNGE)
 * - after the processing of the last node in the current plunge was finished, <em>and only if the LP was not solved
 *   for this node</em> (SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERPSEUDOPLUNGE).
 * \par
 * A plunge is the successive solving of child and sibling nodes in the search tree.
 * The flags listed above can be combined to call the heuristic at multiple times by concatenating them with a bitwise OR.
 * Two useful combinations are already predefined:
 * - after the processing of a node was finished (SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERNODE; combines SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERLPNODE and
 *   SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERPSEUDONODE)
 * - after the processing of the last node in the current plunge was finished (SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERPLUNGE; combines
 *   SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERLPPLUNGE and SCIP_HEURTIMING_AFTERPSEUDOPLUNGE)
 * \par
 * Calling a primal heuristic "before the processing of the node starts" is particularly useful for heuristics
 * that do not need to access the LP solution of the current node. If such a heuristic finds a feasible solution, the
 * leaves of the branching tree exceeding the new primal bound are pruned. It may happen that even the current node can
 * be cut off without solving the LP relaxation. Combinatorial heuristics, like the farthest insert heuristic for the TSP
 * (see examples/TSP/src/HeurFarthestInsert.cpp), are often applicable at this point.
 * \n
 * Very fast primal heuristics that require an LP solution can also be called "after each LP solve during the
 * cut-and-price loop". Rounding heuristics, like the simple and fast LP rounding heuristic
 * (src/scip/heur_simplerounding.c), belong to this group of primal heuristics.
 * \n
 * Most heuristics, however, are called either after a node was completely processed
 * (e.g. expensive rounding heuristics like RENS), or even only after a full plunge was finished (e.g., diving heuristics).
 *
 * \par HEUR_USESSUBSCIP: Does the heuristic use a secondary SCIP instance?
 * Some heuristics and separators solve MIPs or SAT problems using a secondary SCIP instance. Examples are
 * Large Neighborhood Search heuristics such as RINS and Local Branching or the CGMIP separator. To avoid recursion,
 * these plugins usually deactivate all other plugins that solve MIPs. If a heuristic uses a secondary SCIP instance,
 * this parameter has to be TRUE and it is recommended to call SCIPsetSubscipsOff() for the secondary SCIP instance.
 *
 * Computational experiments indicate that for the overall performance of a MIP solver, it is important to evenly
 * spread the application of the heuristics across the branch-and-bound tree. Thus, the assignment of the parameters
 * HEUR_FREQ, HEUR_FREQOFS, and HEUR_TIMING should contribute to this aim.
 *
 * Note that all diving heuristics in the SCIP distribution (see, e.g., src/scip/heur_guideddiving.c) check whether other diving
 * heuristics have already been called at the current node. This can be done by comparing SCIPgetLastDivenode(scip) and
 * SCIPgetNNodes(scip). If the two are equal, and if the current node is not the root node (SCIPgetDepth(scip) > 0), diving
 * heuristics should be delayed by returning the result code 'SCIP_DELAYED'. This is an additional contribution to the goal of
 * not calling multiple similar heuristics at the same node.
 *
 *
 * @section HEUR_DATA Primal Heuristic Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_HeurData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your primal heuristic. For example, you should store the adjustable
 * parameters of the primal heuristic or a working solution in this data structure.
 * If you are using C++, you can add primal heuristic data as usual as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining primal heuristic data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section HEUR_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "heur_myheuristic.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludeHeurMyheuristic(), which also
 * appears in "heur_myheuristic.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the primal heuristic by calling the method SCIPincludeHeur().
 * It is called by the user, if he wants to include the primal heuristic, i.e., if he wants to use the primal heuristic
 * in his application.
 *
 * If you are using primal heuristic data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &heurdata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_HeurData afterwards.
 *
 * You may also add user parameters for your primal heuristic, see the method SCIPincludeHeurFeaspump() in
 * src/scip/heur_oneopt.c for an example where a single Boolean parameter is added.
 *
 *
 * @section HEUR_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a Primal Heuristic
 *
 * Primal heuristic plugins have only one fundamental callback method, namely the HEUREXEC method.
 * This method has to be implemented for every primal heuristic; the other callback methods are optional.
 * In the C++ wrapper class scip::ObjHeur, the scip_exec() method (which corresponds to the HEUREXEC callback) is a virtual
 * abstract member function. You have to implement it in order to be able to construct an object of your primal heuristic
 * class.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_heur.h.
 *
 * @subsection HEUREXEC
 *
 * The HEUREXEC callback is called at different positions during the node processing loop, see HEUR_TIMING. It should
 * search for feasible solutions and add them to the solution pool. For creating a new feasible solution, the
 * methods SCIPcreateSol() and SCIPsetSolVal() can be used. Afterwards, the solution can be added to the storage by
 * calling the method SCIPtrySolFree() (or SCIPtrySol() and SCIPfreeSol()).
 *
 * The HEUREXEC callback gets a SCIP pointer, a pointer to the heuristic itself, the current point in the
 * solve loop and a result pointer as input (see type_heur.h).
 *
 * The heuristic has to set the result pointer appropriately!
 * Therefore it has the following options:
 *  - finding at least one feasible solution (result SCIP_FOUNDSOL)
 *  - stating that the primal heuristic searched, but did not find a feasible solution (result SCIP_DIDNOTFIND)
 *  - stating that the primal heuristic was skipped (result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN)
 *  - stating that the primal heuristic was skipped, but should be called again (result SCIP_DELAYED).
 *
 *
 * @section HEUR_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Primal Heuristic
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.
 * They can be used, for example, to initialize and free private data.
 *
 * @subsection HEURFREE
 *
 * If you are using primal heuristic data, you have to implement this method in order to free the primal heuristic data.
 * This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_HEURFREE(heurFreeMyheuristic)
 * {
 *    SCIP_HEURDATA* heurdata;
 *
 *    heurdata = SCIPheurGetData(heur);
 *    assert(heurdata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &heurdata);
 *
 *    SCIPheurSetData(heur, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your primal heuristic data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the primal heuristic data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection HEURINIT
 *
 * The HEURINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.
 * The primal heuristic may, e.g., use this call to initialize its primal heuristic data.
 *
 * @subsection HEURCOPY
 *
 * The HEURCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to
 * solve a sub-SCIP. By
 * defining this callback as
 * <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified
 * heuristic for all copied SCIP instances. This may deteriorate the performance
 * of primal heuristics using sub-SCIPs.
 *
 * @subsection HEUREXIT
 *
 * The HEUREXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method, the primal heuristic should free all resources that have been allocated for the solving process in
 * HEURINIT.
 *
 * @subsection HEURINITSOL
 *
 * The HEURINITSOL callback is executed when the presolving is finished and the branch-and-bound process is about to
 * begin. The primal heuristic may use this call to initialize its branch-and-bound specific data.
 *
 * @subsection HEUREXITSOL
 *
 * The HEUREXITSOL callback is executed before the branch-and-bound process is freed. The primal heuristic should use this
 * call to clean up its branch-and-bound data, which was allocated in HEURINITSOL.

 * SCIP provides specific support for LP relaxations of constraint integer programs. In addition, relaxation handlers,
 * also called relaxators, can be used to include other relaxations, e.g. Lagrange relaxations or semidefinite
 * relaxations. The relaxation handler manages the necessary data structures and calls the relaxation solver to generate dual
 * bounds and primal solution candidates.
 * \n
 * However, the data to define a single relaxation must either be extracted by the relaxation handler itself (e.g., from
 * the user defined problem data, the LP information, or the integrality conditions), or be provided by the constraint
 * handlers. In the latter case, the constraint handlers have to be extended to support this specific relaxation.
 * \n
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own relaxation handlers using the C interface. It is very easy to
 * transfer the C explanation to C++: whenever a method should be implemented using the SCIP_DECL_RELAX... notion,
 * reimplement the corresponding virtual member function of the abstract scip::ObjRelax wrapper base class.
 * Unfortunately, SCIP does not contain a default relaxation handler plugin, which could be used as an example.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a relaxation handler can be found in the file type_relax.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement a relaxation handler:
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/relax_xyz.c and src/scip/relax_xyz.h into files named "relax_myrelaxator.c"
 *    and "relax_myrelaxator.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "myrelaxator".
 * -# Adjust the properties of the relaxation handler (see \ref RELAX_PROPERTIES).
 * -# Define the relaxation handler data (see \ref RELAX_DATA). This is optional.
 * -# Implement the interface methods (see \ref RELAX_INTERFACE).
 * -# Implement the fundamental callback methods (see \ref RELAX_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS).
 * -# Implement the additional callback methods (see \ref RELAX_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS). This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section RELAX_PROPERTIES Properties of a Relaxation Handler
 *
 * At the top of the new file "relax_myrelaxator.c" you can find the relaxation handler properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the relaxation handler properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjRelax from within your constructor.
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par RELAX_NAME: the name of the relaxation handler.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the relaxation handler.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a relaxation handler with SCIPfindRelax(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two relaxation handlers may have the same name.
 *
 * \par RELAX_DESC: the description of the relaxation handler.
 * This string is printed as a description of the relaxation handler in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par RELAX_PRIORITY: the priority of the relaxation handler.
 * During each relaxation solving round, the included relaxation handlers and the
 * price-and-cut loop for solving the LP relaxation are called in a predefined order, which is given by the priorities
 * of the relaxation handlers.
 * First, the relaxation handlers with non-negative priority are called in the order of decreasing priority.
 * Next, the price-and-cut loop for solving the LP relaxation is executed.
 * Finally, the relaxation handlers with negative priority are called in the order of decreasing priority.
 * \n
 * Usually, you will have only one relaxation handler in your application and thus only have to decide whether it should
 * be called before or after solving the LP relaxation. For this decision you should consider the complexity of
 * the relaxation solving algorithm and the impact of the resulting solution: if your relaxation handler provides a fast
 * algorithm that usually has a high impact (i.e. the relaxation is a good approximation of the
 * feasible region of the subproblem and the solution severely improves the dual bound), it should have a non-negative
 * priority.
 * \n
 * Note that for certain applications, it is useful to disable the LP relaxation and only use your custom relaxation.
 * This can easily be achieved by setting the "lp/solvefreq" parameter to -1.
 *
 * \par RELAX_FREQ: the default frequency for solving the relaxation.
 * The frequency defines the depth levels at which the relaxation solving method \ref RELAXEXEC is called.
 * For example, a frequency of 7 means, that the relaxation solving callback is executed for subproblems that are in depth
 * 0, 7, 14, ... of the branching tree. A frequency of 0 means that the callback is only executed at the root node, i.e.,
 * only the relaxation of the root problem is solved. A frequency of -1 disables the relaxation handler.
 *
 *
 * @section RELAX_DATA Relaxation Handler Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_RelaxData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your relaxation handler. For example, you should store the adjustable
 * parameters of the relaxation handler in this data structure.
 * If you are using C++, you can add relaxation handler data as usual as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining relaxation handler data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section RELAX_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "relax_myrelaxator.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludeRelaxMyrelaxator(), which also
 * appears in "relax_myrelaxator.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the relaxation handler by calling the method SCIPincludeRelax().
 * It is called by the user, if he wants to include the relaxation handler, i.e., if he wants to use the relaxation
 * handler in his application.
 *
 * If you are using relaxation handler data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &relaxdata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_RelaxData afterwards.
 *
 * You may also add user parameters for your relaxation handler, see the method SCIPincludeConshdlrKnapsack() in
 * the \ref cons_knapsack.h "knapsack constraint handler" for an example of how to add user parameters.
 *
 *
 * @section RELAX_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a Relaxation Handler
 *
 * Relaxation handler plugins have only one fundamental callback method, namely the \ref RELAXEXEC method.
 * This method has to be implemented for every relaxation handler; the other callback methods are optional.
 * In the C++ wrapper class scip::ObjRelax, the scip_exec() method (which corresponds to the \ref RELAXEXEC callback) is a virtual
 * abstract member function.
 * You have to implement it in order to be able to construct an object of your relaxation handler class.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_relax.h.
 *
 * @subsection RELAXEXEC
 * The RELAXEXEC is called in each relaxation solving round. It should solve the current
 * subproblem's relaxation.
 *
 * Note that, like the LP relaxation, the relaxation handler should only operate on variables for which the corresponding
 * column exists in the transformed problem. Typical methods called by a relaxation handler are SCIPconstructLP() to
 * make sure that the LP of the current node is constructed and its data can be accessed via calls to SCIPgetLPRowsData()
 * and SCIPgetLPColsData(), SCIPseparateSol() to call the cutting plane separators for a given primal solution, and
 * SCIPupdateLocalLowerbound() to update the current node's dual bound after having solved the relaxation.
 * In addition, you may want to call SCIPtrySolFree() if you think that you have found a feasible primal solution.
 *
 * The primal solution of the relaxation can be stored inside the data structures of SCIP with
 * <code>SCIPsetRelaxSolVal()</code> and <code>SCIPsetRelaxSolVals()</code> and later accessed by
 * <code>SCIPgetRelaxSolVal()</code>.
 * Furthermore, there is a list of external branching candidates, that can be filled by relaxation handlers and constraint handlers,
 * allowing branching rules to take these candidates as a guide on how to split the problem into subproblems.
 * Relaxation handlers should store appropriate candidates in this list using the method <code>SCIPaddExternBranchCand()</code>.
 *
 * Usually, the RELAXEXEC callback only solves the relaxation and provides a lower (dual) bound with a call to
 * SCIPupdateLocalLowerbound().
 * However, it may also produce domain reductions, add additional constraints or generate cutting planes. It has the
 * following options:
 *  - detecting that the node is infeasible in the variable's bounds and can be cut off (result SCIP_CUTOFF)
 *  - adding an additional constraint and stating that the relaxation handler should not be called again on the same
 *    relaxation (result SCIP_CONSADDED)
 *  - reducing a variable's domain and stating that the relaxation handler should not be called again on the same
 *    relaxation (result SCIP_REDUCEDDOM)
 *  - adding a cutting plane to the LP and stating that the relaxation handler should not be called again on the same
 *    relaxation (result SCIP_SEPARATED)
 *  - stating that the relaxation handler solved the relaxation and should not be called again on the same relaxation
 *    (result SCIP_SUCCESS)
 *  - interrupting the solving process to wait for additional input, e.g., cutting planes (result SCIP_SUSPENDED)
 *  - stating that the separator was skipped (result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN).
 *
 * In the above criteria, "the same relaxation" means that the LP relaxation stayed unmodified. This means in particular
 * that no row has been added and no bounds have been modified. For example, changing the bounds of a variable will, as
 * long as it was a COLUMN variable, lead to a modification in the LP such that the relaxation handler is called again
 * after it returned with the result code SCIP_REDUCEDDOM.
 *
 *
 * @section RELAX_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Relaxation Handler
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.
 * They can be used, for example, to initialize and free private data.
 *
 * @subsection RELAXFREE
 *
 * If you are using relaxation handler data, you have to implement this method in order to free the relaxation handler
 * data. This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_RELAXFREE(relaxFreeMyrelaxator)
 * {
 *    SCIP_RELAXDATA* relaxdata;
 *
 *    relaxdata = SCIPrelaxGetData(relax);
 *    assert(relaxdata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &relaxdata);
 *
 *    SCIPrelaxSetData(relax, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your relaxation handler data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the relaxation handler data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection RELAXINIT
 *
 * The RELAXINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.
 * The relaxation handler may, e.g., use this call to initialize its relaxation handler data.
 *
 * @subsection RELAXCOPY
 *
 * The RELAXCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to
 * solve a sub-SCIP. By
 * defining this callback as
 * <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified
 * relaxation handler for all copied SCIP instances. This may deteriorate the performance
 * of primal heuristics using sub-SCIPs.
 *
 * @subsection RELAXEXIT
 *
 * The RELAXEXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method, the relaxation handler should free all resources that have been allocated for the solving process in
 * RELAXINIT.
 *
 * @subsection RELAXINITSOL
 *
 * The RELAXINITSOL callback is executed when the presolving is finished and the branch-and-bound process is about to
 * begin. The relaxation handler may use this call to initialize its branch-and-bound specific data.
 *
 * @subsection REALXEXITSOL
 *
 * The RELAXEXITSOL callback is executed before the branch-and-bound process is freed.
 * The relaxation handler should use this call to clean up its branch-and-bound data.

/**@page READER How to add file readers
 *
 * Mainly, file readers are called to parse an input file and generate a constraint integer programming model. They
 * create constraints and variables and activate variable pricers if necessary. However, they can also be called, for
 * example, to parse an input file containing information about a primal solution or fixing of variables. Besides that
 * it is possible to use some of them for writing (exporting) the problem in a specific format.  \n A complete list of
 * all file readers contained in this release can be found \ref FILEREADERS "here".
 *
 * Since a file reader is also responsible for writing a file, the user may
 * ask why the readers have not the name "filehandler". This name would
 * represent this plugin much better than the used one.
 * \n
 * The used name "readers" is historically grown. In the beginning of SCIP
 * there was no need to write/export problems. Therefore, the the plugin
 * name "readers" was best fitting for this plugin since only reading was essential.
 * It turned out, however, that it is quite nice to write/export certain subproblem during
 * the solving process mainly for debugging. Therefore, a writing callback
 * was added to the "readers" plugin.
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own file readers.
 * Take the file reader for MIPs in IBM's Mathematical Programming System format (src/scip/reader_mps.c) as an example.
 * As all other default plugins, it is written in C. C++ users can easily adapt the code by using the scip::ObjReader wrapper
 * base class and implement the scip_...() virtual methods instead of the SCIP_DECL_READER... callback methods.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a file reader can be found in the file type_reader.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement a file reader named "myreader" in C:
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/reader_xyz.c and src/scip/reader_xyz.h into files named
 *    "reader_myreader.c" and "reader_myreader.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "myreader".
 * -# Adjust the \ref READER_PROPERTIES "properties of the file reader".
 * -# Define the \ref READER_DATA "file reader data". This is optional.
 * -# Implement the \ref READER_INTERFACE "interface methods".
 * -# Implement the \ref READER_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS "fundamental callback methods".
 * -# Implement the \ref READER_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS "additional callback methods". This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section READER_PROPERTIES Properties of a File Reader
 *
 * At the top of the new file "reader_myreader.c" you can find the file reader properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the file reader properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjReader from within your constructor.
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par READER_NAME: the name of the file reader.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the file reader.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a file reader with SCIPfindReader(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two file readers may have the same name.
 *
 * \par READER_DESC: the description of the file reader.
 * This string is printed as a description of the file reader in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par READER_EXTENSION: the file name extension of the file reader.
 * Each file reader is hooked to a single file name extension. It is automatically called if the user wants to read in a
 * file of corresponding name. The extensions of the different file readers have to be unique.
 * Note that the additional extension '.gz', '.z', or '.Z' (indicating a gzip compressed file) are ignored for assigning
 * an input file to a reader.
 * \n
 * It is not possible to hook up a (single) file reader with more than one file extension.
 * It is, however, not necessary to implement the same (parsing/writing) methods more than once, if you want to
 * support several file extension with the same parser. To do so look at the files reader_lp.c
 * and reader_rlp.c. Both support the LP format.
 *
 *
 * @section READER_DATA File Reader Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_ReaderData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your file reader. For example, you should store the adjustable
 * parameters of the file reader in this data structure.
 * If you are using C++, you can add file reader data as usual as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining file reader data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section READER_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "reader_myreader.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludeReaderMyreader(), which also
 * appears in "reader_myreader.h".
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the file reader by calling the method
 * SCIPincludeReader().
 * It is called by the user if he wants to include the file reader, i.e., if he wants to use the file reader in his
 * application.
 *
 * If you are using file reader data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &readerdata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_ReaderData afterwards.
 *
 * You may also add user parameters for your file reader, see the method SCIPincludeReaderLp() in
 * src/scip/reader_lp.c for an example.
 *
 *
 * @section READER_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a File Reader
 *
 * File reader plugins have no fundamental callback methods. This is due to
 * the fact that a file reader can be used for reading and/or writing a
 * file. A file reader is only useful if the reader method \ref READERREAD
 * and/or the writing method \ref READERWRITE is implemented.  One of these
 * methods should be implemented for every file reader; the other callback
 * methods \ref READERCOPY and \ref READERFREE are optional.  In the C++ wrapper class scip::ObjReader, the
 * scip_read() and scip_write() methods (which corresponds to the \ref
 * READERREAD and \ref READERWRITE callback) are virtual member
 * functions. At least one of them should be implemented.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_reader.h.
 *
 *
 * @section READER_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a File Reader
 *
 * File reader plugins contain only additional callback methods, namely the methods \ref READERREAD,
 * \ref READERWRITE, \ref READERFREE, and \ref READERCOPY. Therefore, these are not needed to be implemented. However,
 * at least \ref READERREAD and/or \ref READERWRITE should be implemented (see notes
 * \ref READER_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS "above").
 *
 *
 * @subsection READERREAD
 *
 * The READERREAD callback is called when the user invokes SCIP to read in a file with file name extension
 * corresponding to the READER_EXTENSION property of the file reader. This is usually triggered by a call to the method
 * SCIPreadProb() or by an interactive shell command.
 * The READERREAD callback should parse the input file and perform the desired action, which usually means
 * generating a constraint integer programming model, adding a primal solution, fixing variables
 * in an existing model.
 * \n
 * Typical methods called by a file reader that is used to read/generate constraint
 * integer programming models are, for example,
 *
 * - creating an empty problem: SCIPcreateProb()
 * - creating the variables: SCIPcreateVar(), SCIPchgVarType(), SCIPchgVarLb(), SCIPchgVarUb(), SCIPaddVar(), and
 *   SCIPreleaseVar()
 * - modifying the objective function: SCIPchgVarObj() and SCIPsetObjsense().
 * - creating the constraints: SCIPcreateConsLinear(), SCIPaddCoefLinear(), SCIPchgLhsLinear(), SCIPchgRhsLinear(),
 *   SCIPaddCons(), and SCIPreleaseCons()
 *
 * Primal solutions can only be created for the transformed problem. Therefore, the user has to call SCIPtransformProb()
 * before he reads in the file containing the solution and adds it to the solution pool via the method SCIPreadSol().
 *
 *
 * @subsection READERWRITE
 *
 * The READERWRITE callback is called when the user invokes SCIP to write a problem (original or transformed)
 * in the format the reader supports. This is only possible if this callback is implemented. To write the problem
 * all necessary information is given through the parameters of this callback method (see type_reader.h). This
 * information should be used to output the problem in the requested format. This callback method is usually
 * triggered by the call of the methods SCIPwriteOrigProblem(), SCIPwriteTransProblem(), SCIPprintOrigProblem(),
 * or SCIPprintTransProblem().
 * \n
 * A typical method called by a file reader which is used to write/export a constraint
 * integer programming model is SCIPinfoMessage(). This method outputs a given string into a file
 * or into stdout.
 * \n
 * For an example we refer to the writing method of the MPS reader (see reader_mps.c).
 *
 *
 * @subsection READERCOPY
 *
 * The READERCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to solve a sub-SCIP. By defining this
 * callback as <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified reader for all copied SCIP
 * instances. The question might arise why to copy that plugin. In case of debugging it is nice to be able to
 * write/display the copied instances. Since the reader is in charge of that, you might want to copy the plugin. Below
 * you see a standard implementation.
 *
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_READERCOPY(readerCopyMyreader)
 * {
 *    assert(scip != NULL);
 *    assert(reader != NULL);
 *    assert(strcmp(SCIPreaderGetName(reader), READER_NAME) == 0);
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPincludeReaderMyreader(scip) );
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * @subsection READERFREE
 *
 * If you are using file reader data, you have to implement this method in order to free the file reader data.
 * This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_READERFREE(readerFreeMyreader)
 * {
 *    SCIP_READERDATA* readerdata;
 *
 *    readerdata = SCIPreaderGetData(reader);
 *    assert(readerdata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &readerdata);
 *
 *    SCIPreaderSetData(reader, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your file reader data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the file reader data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.

/**@page DIALOG How to add dialogs
 *
 * SCIP comes with a command line shell which allows the user to read in problem instances, modify the solver's
 * parameters, initiate the optimization and display certain statistics and solution information. This shell consists
 * of dialogs, which are organized as a tree in SCIP. A node of this tree which is not a leaf represents a menu in
 * the shell and the children of this node correspond to the entries of this menu (which can again be menus). All
 * different dialogs are managed by a dialog handler, which, in particular, is responsible for executing the dialog
 * corresponding to the user's command in the shell. The concept of a dialog handler is different to that
 * of a constraint handler, which is used to manage objects of the same structure, see \ref CONS. In particular, SCIP
 * features only one dialog handler (dialog_default.h), whereas there may exist different constraint handlers.
 * \n
 * A complete list of all dialogs contained in this release can be found \ref DIALOGS "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can extend the interactive shell by adding their own dialog.
 * We give the explanation for creating your own source file for each additional dialog. Of course, you can collect
 * different dialogs in one source file. Take src/scip/dialog_default.c, where all default dialog plugins are collected, as an
 * example.
 * As all other default plugins, the default dialog plugin and the template dialog are written in C. C++ users can easily
 * adapt the code by using the scip::ObjDialog wrapper base class and implement the scip_...() virtual methods instead of the
 * SCIP_DECL_DIALOG... callback methods.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a dialog can be found in the file type_dialog.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to add a dialog (assuming your dialog is named "mydialog"):
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/dialog_xyz.c and src/scip/dialog_xyz.h into files named "dialog_mydialog.c"
 *    and "dialog_mydialog.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "mydialog".
 * -# Adjust the \ref DIALOG_PROPERTIES "properties of the dialog".
 * -# Define the \ref DIALOG_DATA "dialog data". This is optional.
 * -# Implement the \ref DIALOG_INTERFACE "interface methods".
 * -# Implement the \ref DIALOG_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS "fundamental callback methods".
 * -# Implement the \ref DIALOG_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS "additional callback methods". This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section DIALOG_PROPERTIES Properties of a Dialog
 *
 * At the top of the new file "dialog_mydialog.c" you can find the dialog properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the dialog properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjDialog from within your constructor.
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par DIALOG_NAME: the name of the dialog.
 * In the interactive shell, this name appears as the command name of the dialog in the parent dialog.
 * Additionally, if you are searching an entry in a menu with SCIPdialogFindEntry(), this name is looked up.
 * Names within one menu have to be unique: no two dialogs in the same menu may have the same name.
 *
 * \par DIALOG_DESC: the description of the dialog.
 * This string is printed as a description of the dialog in the interactive shell if the additional
 * callback method \ref DIALOGDESC is not implemented.
 *
 * \par DIALOG_ISSUBMENU: whether the dialog is a (sub)menu.
 * This parameter states whether the dialog is a menu in the interactive shell, i.e., is the parent of further
 * dialogs.
 *
 *
 * @section DIALOG_DATA Dialog Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_DialogData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your dialog.
 * If you are using C++, you can add dialog data as usual as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining dialog data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section DIALOG_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "dialog_mydialog.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludeDialogMydialog(), which also appears
 * in "dialog_mydialog.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the dialog, which can be done by the following lines of code:
 * \code
 * if( !SCIPdialogHasEntry(parentdialog, DIALOG_NAME) )
 * {
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPcreateDialog(scip, &dialog, dialogExecMydialog, dialogDescMydialog, dialogFreeMydialog,
 *          DIALOG_NAME, DIALOG_DESC, DIALOG_ISSUBMENU, dialogdata) );
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPaddDialogEntry(scip, parentdialog, dialog) );
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPreleaseDialog(scip, &dialog) );
 * }
 * \endcode
 * Here "parentdialog" has to be an existing dialog which is defined to be a menu (see DIALOG_ISSUBMENU), e.g.,
 * the default root dialog. The method SCIPgetRootDialog() returns the root dialog.
 *
 * The interface method is called by the user, if he wants to include the dialog, i.e., if he wants to use the dialog in
 * his application.
 * Note that in order to be able to link the new dialog to an existing default dialog
 * (except the root dialog) it has to be included <b>after the
 * default dialogs plugin</b>, i.e., the SCIPincludeDialogMydialog() call has to occur after the
 * SCIPincludeDialogDefault() call. The SCIPincludeDialogDefault() method is called from within the SCIPincludeDefaultPlugins()
 * method. Therefore, it suffices to include your dialog plugins after you have called SCIPincludeDefaultPlugins().
 * In case you want to add a dialog to the <b>root dialog</b>, you just use the following
 * lines of code to get/create the root dialog.
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP_DIALOG* root;
 *
 * root = SCIPgetRootDialog(scip);
 * if( root == NULL )
 * {
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPcreateRootDialog(scip, &root) );
 * }
 * assert( root != NULL );
 * \endcode
 *
 * Therefore, in this case you do not have to worry about the calls of
 * SCIPincludeDialogDefault() and SCIPincludeDefaultPlugins() .
 *
 * If you are using dialog data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &dialogdata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_DialogData afterwards.
 *
 * Consider the following example. The user wants to add a "drawgraph" command to the root menu of SCIP.
 * He copies the "dialog_xyz.c" and "dialog_xyz.h" files into files "dialog_drawgraph.c" and "dialog_drawgraph.h", respectively.
 * Then, he puts the following code into the SCIPincludeDialogDrawgraph() method, compare SCIPincludeDialogDefault() in
 * src/scip/dialog_default.c:
 * \code
 * SCIP_RETCODE SCIPincludeDialogDrawgraph(
 *    SCIP*                 scip
 *    )
 * {
 *    SCIP_DIALOG* root;
 *    SCIP_DIALOG* dialog;
 *
 *    root = SCIPgetRootDialog(scip);
 *    if( root == NULL )
 *    {
 *       SCIP_CALL( SCIPcreateRootDialog(scip, &root) );
 *    }
 *    assert( root != NULL );
 *
 *    if( !SCIPdialogHasEntry(root, "drawgraph") )
 *    {
 *       SCIP_CALL( SCIPcreateDialog(scip, &dialog, SCIPdialogExecDrawgraph, NULL, NULL,
 *             "drawgraph", "draws the graph for the current problem instance", FALSE, NULL) );
 *       SCIP_CALL( SCIPaddDialogEntry(scip, root, dialog) );
 *       SCIP_CALL( SCIPreleaseDialog(scip, &dialog) );
 *    }
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Using this code, it is even possible to call SCIPincludeDialogDrawgraph() before including the default dialog plugins,
 * and you can also call it multiple times without causing inconsistencies in the dialog structure.
 *
 *
 * @section DIALOG_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a Dialog
 *
 * Dialogs have only one fundamental callback method, namely the \ref DIALOGEXEC method.
 * This method has to be implemented for every dialog; the other callback methods are optional.
 * In the C++ wrapper class scip::ObjDialog, the scip_exec() method (which corresponds to the \ref DIALOGEXEC callback) is a virtual
 * abstract member function.
 * You have to implement it in order to be able to construct an object of your dialog class.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_dialog.h.
 *
 * @subsection DIALOGEXEC
 *
 * The DIALOGEXEC method is invoked, if the user selected the dialog's command name in the parent's menu. It should
 * execute what is stated in DIALOG_DESC, e.g., the display constraint handlers dialog should display information about
 * the constraint handlers included in SCIP, see src/scip/dialog_default.c.
 *
 * For typical methods called by the execution method, have a look at src/scip/dialog_default.c.
 *
 * The callback has to return which dialog should be processed next. This can be, for example, the root dialog
 * (SCIPdialoghdlrGetRoot()), the parent dialog (SCIPdialogGetParent()) or NULL, which stands for closing the interactive
 * shell.
 *
 *
 * @section DIALOG_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Dialog
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.
 * They can be used, for example, to free private data.
 *
 * @subsection DIALOGPFREE
 *
 * If you are using dialog data, you have to implement this method in order to free the dialog data.
 * This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_DIALOGFREE(dialogFreeMydialog)
 * {
 *    SCIP_DIALOGDATA* dialogdata;
 *
 *    dialogdata = SCIPdialogGetData(dialog);
 *    assert(dialogdata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &dialogdata);
 *
 *    SCIPdialogSetData(dialog, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your dialog data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the dialog data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection DIALOGDESC
 *
 * This method is called when the help menu of the parent is displayed. It should output (usually a single line of)
 * information describing the meaning of the dialog.
 * \n
 * If this callback is not implemented, the description string of the dialog (DIALOG_DESC) is displayed instead.
 *
 * @subsection DIALOGCOPY
 *
 * The DIALOGCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to solve a sub-SCIP. By defining this
 * callback as <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of this dialog for all copied SCIP instances. In
 * general there is no need to copy any dialog since it is most unlikely to start the interactive shell of the copied
 * instances.

/**@page DISP How to add display columns
 *
 * While solving a constraint integer program, SCIP displays status information in a column-like fashion. The current
 * number of processed branching tree nodes, the solving time, and the relative gap between primal and dual bound are
 * examples of such display columns. There already exists a wide variety of display columns which can be activated or
 * deactivated on demand, see src/scip/disp_default.c. Additionally, the user can implement his own display columns
 * in order to track problem or algorithm specific values.
 * \n
 * A complete list of all displays contained in this release can be found \ref DISPLAYS "here".
 *
 * We now explain users can add their own display columns.
 * We give the explanation for creating your own source file for each additional display column. Of course, you can collect
 * different additional display columns in one source file.
 * Take src/scip/disp_default.c, where all default display columns are collected, as an example.
 * As all other default plugins, the default display column plugins and the display column template are written in C.
 * C++ users can easily adapt the code by using the scip::ObjDisp wrapper base class and implement the scip_...() virtual methods
 * instead of the SCIP_DECL_DISP... callback methods.
 *
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of a display column can be found in the file type_disp.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement a display column (assuming your display column is named "mydisplaycolumn"):
 * -# Copy the template files src/scip/disp_xyz.c and src/scip/disp_xyz.h into files named "disp_mydisplaycolumn.c"
 *    and "disp_mydisplaycolumn.h".
      \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "mydisplaycolumn".
 * -# Adjust the \ref DISP_PROPERTIES "properties of the display column".
 * -# Define the  \ref DISP_DATA "display column data". This is optional.
 * -# Implement the \ref DISP_INTERFACE "interface methods".
 * -# Implement the \ref DISP_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS "fundamental callback methods".
 * -# Implement the \ref DISP_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS "additional callback methods". This is optional.
 *
 *
 * @section DISP_PROPERTIES Properties of a Display Column
 *
 * At the top of the new file "disp_mydisplaycolumn.c" you can find the display column properties.
 * These are given as compiler defines.
 * In the C++ wrapper class, you have to provide the display column properties by calling the constructor
 * of the abstract base class scip::ObjDisp from within your constructor.
 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par DISP_NAME: the name of the display column.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the display column.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for a display column with SCIPfindDisp(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two display columns may have the same name.
 *
 * \par DISP_DESC: the description of the display column.
 * This string is printed as a description of the display column in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par DISP_HEADER: the header of the display column.
 * This string is printed as the header of the display column in the status information display.
 *
 * \par DISP_WIDTH: the width of the display column.
 * This parameter defines the width (number of characters) of the display column. The value of the parameter has to be
 * greater than or equal to the number of characters in the header string.
 *
 * \par DISP_PRIORITY: the priority of the display column.
 * The total width of status information lines is bounded by the parameter "display width". The display columns actually contained
 * in the status information display are selected in decreasing order of their priority. Furthermore, the user can force
 * columns to be displayed or not to be displayed in the status information display. For that, he has to switch the value
 * of the display column's parameter "active" from "auto" (its default value) to "on" or "off", respectively.
 *
 * \par DISP_POSITION: the relative position of the display column.
 * In the status information display, the display columns are arranged from left to right in increasing order of their
 * relative position.
 *
 * \par DISP_STRIPLINE: the default for whether the display column should be separated with a line from its right neighbor.
 * This parameter states whether the display column should be separated with the string "|" from its right neighbor. In so
 * doing, the clearness of the status information display may improve.
 *
 * @section DISP_DATA Display Column Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find a struct which is called "struct SCIP_DispData".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your display column. For example, you should store the adjustable
 * parameters of the display column in this data structure.
 * If you are using C++, you can add display column data as usual as object variables to your class.
 * \n
 * Defining display column data is optional. You can leave the struct empty.
 *
 *
 * @section DISP_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "disp_mydisplaycolumn.c" you can find the interface method SCIPincludeDispMydisplaycolumn(), which also
 * appears in "disp_mydisplaycolumn.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for notifying SCIP of the presence of the display column by calling the method
 * SCIPincludeDisp().
 *
 * The interface method is called by the user, if he wants to include the display column, i.e., if he wants to use the display column in his
 * application.
 *
 * If you are using display column data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &dispdata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_DispData afterwards.
 *
 * Although this is very uncommon, you may also add user parameters for your display column, see the method
 * SCIPincludeConshdlrKnapsack() in the \ref cons_knapsack.h "knapsack constraint handler" for an example.
 *
 *
 * @section DISP_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS Fundamental Callback Methods of a Display Column
 *
 * Display column plugins have only one fundamental callback method, namely the \ref DISPOUTPUT method.
 * This method has to be implemented for every display column; the other callback methods are optional.
 * In the C++ wrapper class scip::ObjDisp, the scip_output() method (which corresponds to the \ref DISPOUTPUT callback) is a virtual
 * abstract member function.
 * You have to implement it in order to be able to construct an object of your display column class.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods can be found in type_disp.h.
 *
 * @subsection DISPOUTPUT
 *
 * The DISPOUTPUT callback is called after each pricing loop during node processing and after a node has been processed.
 * In addition, at the root node, the callback is executed after each iteration of the price-and-cut loop.
 * It should write the display column information for the current node to a given output file stream.
 *
 * Typical methods called by a display column are, for example, SCIPdispLongint(), SCIPdispInt(), SCIPdispTime(), and
 * SCIPinfoMessage().
 *
 *
 * @section DISP_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Display Column
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.
 * They can be used, for example, to initialize and free private data.
 *
 * @subsection DISPCOPY
 *
 * The DISPCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to solve a sub-SCIP. By defining this callback
 * as <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified column. In general it is probably not needed to
 * implement that callback since the output of the copied instance is usually suppressed. In the other case or for
 * debugging the callback should be implement.
 *
 *
 * @subsection DISPFREE
 *
 * If you are using display column data, you have to implement this method in order to free the display column data.
 * This can be done by the following procedure:
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_DISPFREE(dispFreeMydisplaycolumn)
 * {
 *    SCIP_DISPDATA* dispdata;
 *
 *    dispdata = SCIPdispGetData(disp);
 *    assert(dispdata != NULL);
 *
 *    SCIPfreeMemory(scip, &dispdata);
 *
 *    SCIPdispSetData(disp, NULL);
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * If you have allocated memory for fields in your display column data, remember to free this memory
 * before freeing the display column data itself.
 * If you are using the C++ wrapper class, this method is not available.
 * Instead, just use the destructor of your class to free the member variables of your class.
 *
 * @subsection DISPINIT
 *
 * The DISPINIT callback is executed after the problem is transformed.
 * The display column may, e.g., use this call to initialize its display column data.
 *
 * @subsection DISPEXIT
 *
 * The DISPEXIT callback is executed before the transformed problem is freed.
 * In this method, the display column should free all resources that have been allocated for the solving process in
 * \ref DISPINIT.
 *
 * @subsection DISPINITSOL
 *
 * The DISPINITSOL callback is executed when the presolving is finished and the branch-and-bound process is about to
 * begin. The display column may use this call to initialize its branch-and-bound specific data.
 *
 * @subsection DISPEXITSOL
 *
 * The DISPEXITSOL callback is executed before the branch-and-bound process is freed. The display column should use this
 * call to clean up its branch-and-bound data specific data.

/**@page EVENT How to add event handler
 *
 * While solving a constraint integer program, SCIP drops thousands of events such as SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARFIXED (a
 * complete list of all events is given in type_event.h). These events can be caught and used to do something after a
 * certain event happens. Events can be used to speed up the solution process. For example, the set partitioning
 * constraint is only worth propagating if one of the involved variables is fixed. This can be detected by
 * catching the event SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARFIXED. To be able to catch an event it is necessary to write an event handler
 * which defines what to do after a certain event was caught.
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own event handlers. We give the explanation for creating your own
 * source file for each additional event handler. Of course, you can collect different event handlers in one source file
 * or you can put the event handler directly into the constraint handler.  In a \ref EVENTUSAGE "second step" we discuss

 * types of events.
 *
 * Take src/scip/cons_logior.c, where the event handler is directly included into the constraint handler. As all other
 * default plugins, the event handlers are written in C. C++ users can easily adapt the code by using the scip::ObjEventhdlr

 * @subsection EVENTEXEC
 *
 * The EVENTEXEC callback is called after the requested event happened. Then the event handler can do some action in
 * reaction to the event.
 *
 * Typical the execution method sets a parameter to TRUE to indicate later in solving process that something happened
 * which should be analyzed further. In the \ref cons_knapsack.h "knapsack constraint handler" you find such a typical

 * @section EVENT_ADDITIONALCALLBACKS Additional Callback Methods of a Event Handler
 *
 * The additional callback methods do not need to be implemented in every case.
 * They can be used, for example, to initialize and free private data.
 *
 * @subsection EVENTCOPY
 *
 * The EVENTCOPY callback is executed when a SCIP instance is copied, e.g. to solve a sub-SCIP. By defining this
 * callback as <code>NULL</code> the user disables the execution of the specified event handler for all copied SCIP
 * instances. Note that in most cases the event handler in the copied instance will be initialize by those objects (such
 * as constraint handlers or propagators) which need this event handler (see \ref cons_knapsack.h). In these cases the copy
 * callback can be ignored. In case of general events, such as a new best solution being found
 * (SCIP_EVENTTYPE_BESTSOLFOUND), you might want to implement that callback. The event handler example which you find
 * in the directory "examples/Eventhdlr/" uses that callback.
 *
 * \code

 * call to clean up its branch-and-bound data specific data.
 *
 * @section EVENTUSAGE Catching and Dropping Events
 *
 * After you have implemented the event handler, you have to tell SCIP for which events this event handler should be
 * used. This can be a general events, such as <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_BESTSOLFOUND</code>, or a variable event which is the most common
 * way.
 *
 * In case of a general (not variable) event you use the function SCIPcatchEvent() to attach to an even and
 * SCIPdropEvent() to release this event later.
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPcatchEvent( scip, SCIP_EVENTTYPE_BESTSOLFOUND, eventhdlr, NULL, NULL) );
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPdropEvent( scip, SCIP_EVENTTYPE_BESTSOLFOUND, eventhdlr, NULL, NULL) );
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you want trigger some variable event, you use the method SCIPcatchVarEvent() to attach the variable event and
 * SCIPdropVarEvent() to drop it later.
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPcatchVarEvent( scip, var, SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARFIXED, eventhdlr, NULL, NULL) );
 * \endcode
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPdropVarEvent( scip, var, SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARFIXED, eventhdlr, NULL, NULL) );
 * \endcode
 *
 * @section EVENTTYPES Event types
 *
 * All available events are listed in type_event.h. There are atomic events such as <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARFIXED</code>
 * and combined events such as <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARCHANGED</code>. The events are encoded via bit masks. Each atomic
 * event has a unique power of two. This enables combination of the atomic events.
 *
 * SCIP only throws atomic events. However, an event handler might be interested in bunch of events. Through the
 * underlying bit masks it is possible to combine the atomic events. For example, <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARCHANGED</code>
 * is an event which combines the events <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARFIXED</code>, <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARUNLOCKED</code>,
 * <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_OBJCHANGED</code>, <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_GBDCHANGED</code>,
 * <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_DOMCHANGED</code>, and <code>SCIP_EVENTTYPE_IMPLADDED</code>.
 *
 * \code
 * #define SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARCHANGED     (SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARFIXED | SCIP_EVENTTYPE_VARUNLOCKED | SCIP_EVENTTYPE_OBJCHANGED
 *                                    | SCIP_EVENTTYPE_GBDCHANGED | SCIP_EVENTTYPE_DOMCHANGED | SCIP_EVENTTYPE_IMPLADDED)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Depending on the event type, the event offers different information. The methods which can be used to gain
 * access to this information are given in pub_event.h.

/**@page NLPI How to add interfaces to nonlinear programming solvers
 *
 * NLPIs are used to interface a solver for nonlinear programs (NLP).
 * It is used, e.g., to solve convex relaxations of the problem or to find locally optimal solutions of
 * nonlinear relaxations or subproblems.
 * The NLPI has been designed such that it can be used independently from SCIP.
 *
 * While the NLPI itself corresponds to the solver interface, the NLPIPROBLEM corresponds to the
 * (solver specific) representation of a concrete nonlinear program.
 * An NLP is specified as a set of indexed variables with variable bounds, an objective function,
 * and a set of constraints, where each constraint is specified as a function which is restricted to lie
 * between given left and right hand sides (possibly infinite).
 * A function consists of a linear, quadratic, and general nonlinear part.
 * The linear and quadratic parts are specified via variable indices and coefficients, while the
 * general nonlinear part is specified via an expression tree.
 * That is, the user of the NLPI does not provide function evaluation callbacks but an algebraic representation of the NLP.
 * Interfaces for solvers that require function evaluations can make use of the NLPIORACLE, which
 * provides a set of methods to compute functions values, gradients, Jacobians, and Hessians for a given NLP.
 * See the interface to Ipopt for an example on how to use the NLPIORACLE.
 *
 * A complete list of all NLPIs contained in this release can be found \ref NLPIS "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own NLP solver interface.
 * Take the interface to Ipopt (src/nlpi/nlpi_ipopt.cpp) as an example.
 * Unlike most other plugins, it is written in C++.
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of an NLPI, in particular for their input parameters,
 * can be found in the file type_nlpi.h.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement an NLPI:
 * -# Copy the template files src/nlpi/nlpi_xyz.c and src/nlpi/nlpi_xyz.h into files named "nlpi_mynlpi.c"
 *    and "nlpi_mynlpi.h".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor and replace all occurrences of "xyz" by "mynlpi".
 * -# Adjust the properties of the nlpi (see \ref NLPI_PROPERTIES).
 * -# Define the NLPI and NLPIPROBLEM data (see \ref NLPI_DATA).
 * -# Implement the interface methods (see \ref NLPI_INTERFACE).
 * -# Implement the fundamental callback methods (see \ref NLPI_FUNDAMENTALCALLBACKS).
 *
 *
 * @section NLPI_PROPERTIES Properties of an NLPI
 *
 * At the top of the new file "nlpi_mynlpi.c", you can find the NLPI properties.

 * The properties you have to set have the following meaning:
 *
 * \par NLPI_NAME: the name of the NLP solver interface.
 * This name is used in the interactive shell to address the NLPI.
 * Additionally, if you are searching for an NLPI with SCIPfindNLPI(), this name is looked up.
 * Names have to be unique: no two NLPIs may have the same name.
 *
 * \par NLPI_DESC: the description of the NLPI.
 * This string is printed as a description of the NLPI in the interactive shell.
 *
 * \par NLPI_PRIORITY: the priority of the NLPI.
 * If an NLP has to be solved, an NLP solver has to be selected.
 * By default, the solver with the NLPI with highest priority is selected.
 * The priority of an NLPI should be set according to performance of the solver:
 * solvers that provide fast algorithms that are usually successful on a wide range of problems should have a high priority.
 * An easy way to list the priorities of all NLPIs is to type "display nlpis" in the interactive shell of SCIP.
 *
 * @section NLPI_DATA NLPI Data
 *
 * Below the header "Data structures" you can find structs which are called "struct SCIP_NlpiData" and "struct SCIP_NlpiProblem".
 * In this data structure, you can store the data of your solver interface and of a specific NLP problem.
 * For example, you could store a pointer to the block memory data structure in the SCIP_NlpiData data structure
 * and store a pointer to an NLPIoracle in the SCIP_NlpiProblem data structure.
 *
 * @section NLPI_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * At the bottom of "nlpi_mynlpi.c", you can find the interface method SCIPcreateNlpSolverXyz(),
 * which also appears in "nlpi_mynlpi.h".
 * \n
 * This method only has to be adjusted slightly.
 * It is responsible for creating an NLPI that contains all properties and callback methods of your
 * solver interface by calling the method SCIPnlpiCreate().
 * SCIPcreateNlpSolverXyz() is called by the user (e.g., SCIP), if he wants to use this solver interface in his application.
 *
 * If you are using NLPI data, you have to allocate the memory for the data at this point.
 * You can do this by calling:
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPallocMemory(scip, &nlpidata) );
 * \endcode
 * You also have to initialize the fields in struct SCIP_NlpiData afterwards. For freeing the
 * NLPI data, see \ref NLPIFREE.
 *
 *

/**@page EXPRINT How to add interfaces to expression interpreters
 *
 * An expression interpreter is a tool to compute point-wise and interval-wise the function values, gradients, and
 * derivatives of algebraic expressions which are given in the form of an expression tree.
 * It is used, e.g., by an NLP solver interface to compute Jacobians and Hessians for the solver.
 *
 * The expression interpreter interface in SCIP has been implemented similar to those of the LP solver interface (LPI).
 * For one binary, exactly one expression interpreter has to be linked.
 * The expression interpreter API has been designed such that it can be used independently from SCIP.
 *
 * A complete list of all expression interpreters contained in this release can be found \ref EXPRINTS "here".
 *
 * We now explain how users can add their own expression interpreters.
 * Take the interface to CppAD (\ref exprinterpret_cppad.cpp) as an example.
 * Unlike most other plugins, it is written in C++.
 *
 * Additional documentation for the callback methods of an expression interpreter, in particular for their input parameters,
 * can be found in the file \ref exprinterpret.h
 *
 * Note that the expression interpreter API has <b>BETA status</b> and thus may change in the next version.
 *
 * Here is what you have to do to implement an expression interpreter:
 * -# Copy the file \ref exprinterpret_none.c into a file named "exprinterpreti_myexprinterpret.c".
 *    \n
 *    Make sure to adjust your Makefile such that these files are compiled and linked to your project.
 * -# Open the new files with a text editor.
 * -# Define the expression interpreter data (see \ref EXPRINT_DATA).
 * -# Implement the interface methods (see \ref EXPRINT_INTERFACE).
 *
 *
 * @section EXPRINT_DATA Expression Interpreter Data
 *
 * In "struct SCIP_ExprInt", you can store the general data of your expression interpreter.
 * For example, you could store a pointer to the block memory data structure.
 *
 * @section EXPRINT_INTERFACE Interface Methods
 *
 * The expression interpreter has to implement a set of interface method.
 * In your "exprinterpret_myexprinterpret.c", these methods are mostly dummy methods that return error codes.

 *
 * @subsection SCIPexprintGetCapability

 * i.e., whether it can evaluate gradients, Hessians, or do interval arithmetic.
 *
 * @subsection SCIPexprintCreate
 *
 * The SCIPexprintCreate method is called to create an expression interpreter data structure.
 * The method should initialize a "struct SCIP_ExprInt" here.

/**@page CONF How to use conflict analysis
 *
 * Conflict analysis is a way to automatically use the information obtained from infeasible nodes
 * in the branch-and-bound tree.
 *
 * Once a node is declared infeasible, SCIP automatically tries to infer a constraint that explains the reason for the
 * infeasibility, in order to avoid similar situations later in the search.  This explanation essentially consists of a
 * constraint stating that at least one of its variables should have a bound different from the current infeasible node,
 * because the current setting led to infeasibility. Clearly, all variables that are fixed in the current infeasible
 * node would yield such a constraint (since this leads to infeasibility). The key point rather is to infer a "small"
 * constraint that does the same job. SCIP handles this by several heuristics. For this, SCIP sets up a
 * so-called (directed) conflict graph. The nodes in this graph correspond to bound changes of variables and an arc (@a
 * u, @a v) means that the bound change corresponding to @a v is based on the bound change of @a u. In general, a node
 * will have several ingoing arcs which represent all bound changes that have been used to infer (propagate) the bound
 * change in question. The graph also contains source nodes for each bound that has been changed during branching and an
 * artificial target node representing the conflict, i.e., the infeasibility. Essentially, SCIP heuristically constructs
 * a cut in this graph that involves few "branching nodes". For details on the techniques that SCIP uses,
 * we refer to the paper @par
 * Tobias Achterberg, Conflict Analysis in Mixed Integer Programming@n
 * Discrete Optimization, 4, 4-20 (2007)
 *
 * For conflict analysis to work well, the author of a constraint handler or a propagator has to
 * implement three kinds of functionality:
 *
 * -# If one detects infeasibility, one should initiate conflict analysis, see below.
 * -# During propagation, one should call the right functions to fix variables.
 * -# One should implement the <em>so-called reverse propagation</em>.
 *
 * If this functionality is not implemented, SCIP will still work correctly, but cannot use the information of the constraint
 * handler or the propagator for conflict analysis. In this case, each bound reduction performed by the constraint
 * handler/propagator will be treated as if it had been a branching decision.
 *
 * @section INITCONFS Initiating Conflict Analysis
 *
 * If one detects infeasibility within propagation, one should do the following:
 * -# Call SCIPinitConflictAnalysis().
 * -# Inform SCIP about the variable bounds that are the reason for the detection of infeasibility
 * via the functions SCIPaddConflictLb(), SCIPaddConflictUb(), SCIPaddConflictBd(), or
 * SCIPaddConflictBinvar(). If there is more than one valid explanation of infeasibility, either one can be used.
 * Typically, smaller explanations tend to be better.
 * -# Call SCIPanalyzeConflict() from a propagator or SCIPanalyzeConflictCons() from a constraint
 * handler.
 *
 * This functionality allows SCIP to set up the conflict graph and perform a conflict analysis.
 *
 * @section Propagation
 *
 * When propagating variable domains, SCIP needs to be informed that the deduced variable bounds should be
 * used in conflict analysis. This can be done by the functions SCIPinferVarLbCons(),
 * SCIPinferVarUbCons(), and SCIPinferBinvarCons() for constraint handlers and SCIPinferVarLbProp(),
 * SCIPinferVarUbProp(), and SCIPinferBinvarProp() for propagators. You can pass one integer of
 * information that should indicate the reason of the propagation and can be used in reverse
 * propagation, see the next section.
 *
 * @section RESPROP Reverse Propagation
 *
 * Reverse Propagation is used to build up the conflict graph. Essentially, it provides an algorithm to detect the arcs
 * leading to a node in the conflict graph, i.e., the bound changes responsible for the new bound change deduced during
 * propagation. Reverse Propagation needs to be implemented in the RESPROP callback functions of constraint handlers or
 * propagators. These callbacks receive the following information: the variable which is under investigation (@p
 * infervar), the corresponding bound change (@p bdchgidx, @p boundtype), and the integer (@p inferinfo) that has been
 * supplied during propagation.
 *
 * One can use SCIPvarGetUbAtIndex() or SCIPvarGetLbAtIndex() to detect the bounds before or after the propagation that
 * should be investigated. Then the bounds that were involved should be passed to SCIP via SCIPaddConflictLb() and
 * SCIPaddConflictUb().  If there is more than one valid explanation of infeasibility, either one can be used.
 * Typically, smaller explanations tend to be better.
 *
 * Details and (more) examples are given in Sections @ref CONSRESPROP and @ref PROPRESPROP.
 *
 * @section Example
 *
 * Consider the constraint handler @p cons_linearordering.c in the linear ordering example (see @p
 * example/LOP directory). This constraint handler propagates the equations \f$x_{ij} + x_{ji} =
 * 1\f$ and triangle inequalities \f$x_{ij} + x_{jk} + x_{ki} \leq 2\f$.
 *
 * When propagating the equation and @p vars[i][j] is fixed to 1, the constraint handler uses
 * \code
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPinferBinvarCons(scip, vars[j][i], FALSE, cons, i*n + j, &infeasible, &tightened) );
 * \endcode
 * Thus, variable @p vars[j][i] is fixed to 0 (@p FALSE), and it passes @p i*n + @p j as @p inferinfo.
 *
 * When it propagates the triangle inequality and @p vars[i][j] and @p vars[j[k] are fixed to 1, the constraint handler uses
 * \code
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPinferBinvarCons(scip, vars[k][i], FALSE, cons, n*n + i*n*n + j*n + k, &infeasible, &tightened) );
 * \endcode
 * Thus, in this case, variable @p vars[k][i] is fixed to 0 and @p n*n + @p i*n*n + @p j*n + @p k is
 * passed as inferinfo.
 *
 * In reverse propagation, the two cases can be distinguished by @p inferinfo: if it is less than @p
 * n*n, we deal with an equation, otherwise with a triangle inequality. The constraint handler can then extract the
 * indices @p i, @p j (and @p k in the second case) from inferinfo.
 *
 * In the first case it has to distinguish whether @p vars[i][j] is fixed to 0 or 1 &ndash; by calling SCIPaddConflictLb()
 * or SCIPaddConflictUb(), respectively, with variable @p vars[j][i]. In the second case, it is clear that the only
 * possible propagation is to fix @p vars[i][j] to 0 when @p vars[k][i] and @p vars[j][k] are fixed to 1. It then calls
 * SCIPaddConflictLb() for both @p vars[k][i] and @p vars[j][k].

/**@page OBJ Creating, capturing, releasing, and adding data objects
 *
 *  Data objects (variables, constraints, rows, ... ) are subject to reference counting
 *  to avoid expensive copying operations. This concept is similar to smart pointers.
 *  Creating such an object (e.g., by calling SCIPcreateVar()) will set the
 *  reference counter to one. Capturing an object (e.g., by calling SCIPcaptureVar()) increases the reference counter,
 *  releasing it (e.g., by calling SCIPreleaseVar()) decreases the counter. If the reference counter gets zero, the
 *  object will be destroyed automatically.
 *
 *  Remember that a created data object is automatically captured. If the user
 *  doesn't need the object anymore, he has to call the object's release method.
 *
 *  When a data object is added to SCIP (e.g., by calling SCIPaddVar()) , it is captured again, such that a
 *  release call does not destroy the object. If SCIP doesn't need the object
 *  anymore, it is automatically released.
 *
 *  E.g., if the user calls
 * \code
 *  SCIPcreateVar(); // reference counter 1
 *  SCIPaddVar(); // reference counter 2
 *  SCIPreleaseVar(); // reference counter 1
 * \endcode
 *  the reference counter will be 1 afterwards, and the variable will be destroyed, if SCIP frees the problem.
 *  If the user wants to use this variable, e.g. for extracting statistics after SCIP was finished, the user must not call
 *  SCIPreleaseVar() right after adding the variable, but before terminating the program.

/**@page PARAM Adding additional user parameters
 *
 *  Users may add their own parameters to SCIP by calling SCIPaddXyzParam(). Using
 *  this method, there are two possibilities for where to store the actual parameter value:
 *   - If the given valueptr is NULL, SCIP stores the parameter value internally, and
 *     the user can only access the value with the SCIPgetXyzParam() and
 *     SCIPsetXyzParam() calls.
 *   - If the given valueptr is not NULL, SCIP stores the parameter value at the given
 *     address, and the user can directly manipulate the value at this address.
 *     He has to be careful with memory management in string parameters: when the
 *     SCIPaddStringParam() method is called, the given address must hold a char*
 *     pointer with value NULL. The default value is then copied into this pointer,
 *     allocating memory with BMSallocMemoryArray(). If the parameter is changed, the
 *     old string is freed with BMSfreeMemoryArray() and the new one is copied to a new
 *     memory area allocated with BMSallocMemoryArray(). When the parameter is freed,
 *     the memory is freed with BMSfreeMemoryArray().
 *     The user should not interfere with this internal memory management. Accessing
 *     the string parameter through the given valueptr is okay as long as it does not
 *     involve reallocating memory for the string.
 *
 *  In some cases, it is necessary to keep track of changes in a parameter.
 *  If this is the case, the user can define a method by the PARAMCHGD callback and use this method as
 *  the @c paramchgd parameter of the @c SCIPaddXyzParam() method, also giving a pointer to the data, which is
 *  needed in this method, as @c paramdata. If this method is not NULL, it is called every time
 *  the value of the parameter is changed.

/**@page DEBUG Debugging
 *
 *  If you want to debug your own code that uses SCIP, here are some tips and tricks:
 *
 *  - Use the debug mode (<code>make OPT=dbg</code>, see \ref MAKE) and run the code.
 *  - Use asserts in your code (see \ref CODE).
 *  - Turn on additional debug output by placing <code>\#define SCIP_DEBUG</code> at the top of SCIP files you
 *    want to analyze. This will output messages included in the code using <code>SCIPdebugMessage()</code> (see \ref EXAMPLE_1).
 *    We recommend to also use <code>SCIPdebugMessage()</code> in your own code for being able to activate
 *    debug output in the same way.
 *  - If available on your system, we recommend to use a debugger like gdb to trace all function calls on the stack,
 *    display values of certain expressions, manually break the running code, and so forth.
 *  - If available on your system, you can use software like <a href="http://valgrind.org">valgrind</a> to check for uninitialized
 *    values or segmentation faults.
 *  - For checking the usage of SCIP memory, you can use
 *    <code>SCIPprintMemoryDiagnostic()</code>. This outputs memory that is currently in use. This is
 *    almost always only useful after a <code>SCIPfree()</code> call.
 *  - If your code cuts off a feasible solution, but you do not know which component is responsible,
 *    you can define <code>SCIP_DEBUG_SOLUTION</code> in the file <code>debug.h</code> to be a filename
 *    containing a solution in SCIP format (see \ref EXAMPLE_2).
 *    This solution is then read and it is checked for every cut, whether the solution violates the cut.
 *
 *  @section EXAMPLE_1 How to activate debug messages
 *    For example, if we include a <code>\#define SCIP_DEBUG</code> at the top of \ref heur_oneopt.h and recompile in DBG mode,
 *    and run the scip interactive shell to solve p0033.mps from the miplib, we get some output like:

/**@page TEST How to run automated tests with SCIP
 *
 *  SCIP comes along with a set of useful tools that allow to perform automated tests. The
 *  following is a step-by-step guide from setting up the test environment for evaluation and
 *  customization of test runs.
 *
 *
 *  @section SETUP Setting up the test environment
 *
 *  At first you should create a file listing all problem instances that should be part of the test.
 *  This file has to be located in the the directory <code>scip/check/</code>
 *  and has to have the file extension <code>.test</code>, e.g., <code>testrun.test</code>,
 *  in order to be found by the <code>scip/check/check.sh</code> script.
 *  \n
 *  All test problems can be listed in the <code>test</code>-file by a relative path,
 *  e.g., <code>../../problems/instance1.lp</code> or absolute path, e.g., <code>/home/problems/instance2.mps</code>
 *  in this file. Only one problem should be listed each on line (since the command <code>cat</code> is used to parse this file).
 *  Note that these problems have to be readable for SCIP in order to solve them.
 *  However, you can use different file formats.
 *
 *  Optionally, you can provide a solution file in the <code>scip/check/</code> directory containing
 *  known information about the feasibility and the best known objective values for the test instances.
 *  SCIP can use these values to verify the results. The file has to have the same basename as the
 *  <code>.test</code>-file, i.e., in our case <code>testrun.solu</code>. One line can only contain
 *  information about one test instance. A line has to start with the type of information given:
 *
 *  - <code>=opt=</code> stating that a problem name with an optimal objective value follows
 *  - <code>=best=</code> stating that a problem name with a best know objective value follows
 *  - <code>=inf=</code> stating that a problem name follows which is infeasible
 *
 *  With these information types you can encode for an instance named <code>instance1.lp</code> the following
 *  information:
 *  - The instance has a known optimal (objective) value of 10.
 *   \code
 *   =opt=  instance1 10
 *   \endcode
 *  - The instance has a best known solution with objective value 15.
 *   \code
 *   =best=  instance1 15
 *   \endcode
 *  - The instance is feasible (but has no objective function or we don't know a solution value)
 *   \code
 *   =feas=  instance1
 *   \endcode
 *  - The instance is infeasible.
 *   \code
 *   =inf=  instance1
 *   \endcode
 *
 *  If you don't know whether the instance is feasible or not (so the status is unknown),
 *  you can omit the instance in the <code>solu</code>-file or write
 *   \code
 *   =unkn=  instance1
 *   \endcode
 *
 * <b>Note that in all lines the file extension of the file name is omitted.</b>
 *  \n
 *  See the files <code>scip/check/short.test</code> and <code>scip/check/short.solu</code>
 *  for an example of a <code>test</code>-file and its corresponding <code>solu</code>-file.
 *
 *
 *
 *  @section STARTING Starting a test run
 *
 *
 *  \code
 *  make TEST=testrun test
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  in the SCIP root directory. Note that <code>testrun</code> is exactly the basename of our
 *  <code>test</code>-file (<code>testrun.test</code>). This will cause SCIP to solve our test instances
 *  one after another and to create various output files (see \ref EVAL).
 *
 *
 *  @section EVAL Evaluating a test run
 *
 *  During computation, SCIP automatically creates the directory <code>scip/check/results/</code>
 *  (if it does not already exist) and stores the following output files there.
 *
 *  \arg <code>*.out</code> - output of <code>stdout</code>
 *  \arg <code>*.err</code> - output of <code>stderr</code>
 *  \arg <code>*.set</code> - copy of the used settings file
 *
 *  \arg <code>*.res</code> - ASCII table containing a summary of the computational results
 *  \arg <code>*.tex</code> - TeX table containing a summary of the computational results
 *  \arg <code>*.pav</code> - <a href="http://www.gamsworld.org/performance/paver">PAVER</a> output
 *
 *  The last three files in the above list, i.e., the files containing a summary of the computational results,
 *  can also be generated manually. Therefore the user has to call the <code>evalcheck.sh</code> script in the
 *  @c check directory with the corresponding @c out file as argument. For example, this may be useful if the user stopped the
 *  test before it was finished, in which case the last three files will not be automatically generated by SCIP.
 *
 *  The last column of the ASCII summary table contains the solver status. We distinguish the following statuses: (in order of priority)
 *
 *  \arg abort: solver broke before returning solution
 *  \arg fail: solver cut off a known feasible solution (value of the <code>solu</code>-file is beyond the dual bound;
 *  especially of problem is claimed to be solved but solution is not the optimal solution)
 *  \arg ok: solver solved problem with the value in solu-file
 *  \arg solved: solver solved problem which has no (optimal) value in solu-file (since we here cannot detect the direction
 *  of optimization, it is possible that a solver claims an optimal solution which contradicts a known feasible solution)
 *  \arg better: solver found solution better than known best solution (or no solution was noted in the <code>solu</code>-file so far)
 *  \arg gaplimit, sollimit: solver reached gaplimit or limit of number of solutions (at present: only in SCIP)
 *  \arg timeout: solver reached any other limit (like time or nodes)
 *  \arg unknown: otherwise
 *
 *  Additionally the <code>evalcheck.sh</code> script can generate a <code>solu</code>-file by calling
 *  \code
 *  ./evalcheck.sh writesolufile=1 NEWSOLUFILE=<solu-file> <out-file>
 *  \endcode
 *  where <code><solu-file></code> denotes the filename of the new file where the solutions shall be
 *  (and <code><out-file></code> denotes the output (<code>.out</code>) files to evaluate).
 *
 *  Another feature can be enabled by calling:
 *  \code
 *  ./evalcheck.sh printsoltimes=1 ...
 *  \endcode
 *  The output has two additional columns containing the solving time until the first and the best solution was found.
 *
 *
 *  @b Note: The @em basename of all these files is the same and has the following structure
 *  which allows us to reconstruct the test run:
 *
 *  \code
 *  check.<test name>.<binary>.<machine name>.<setting name>
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  \arg <<code>test name</code>> indicates the name of the the test file, e.g., <code>testrun</code>
 *  \arg <<code>binary</code>> defines the used binary, e.g., <code>scip-1.1.0.linux.x86.gnu.opt.spx</code>
 *  \arg <<code>machine name</code>> tells the name of the machine, e.g., <code>mycomputer</code>
 *  \arg <<code>setting name</code>> denotes the name of the used settings, e.g., <code>default</code>
 *    means the (SCIP) default settings were used
 *
 *  Using the examples out of the previous listing the six file names would have the name:
 *
 *  \code
 *  check.testrun.scip-1.1.0.linux.x86.gnu.opt.spx.mycomputer.default.<out,err,set,res,tex,pav>
 *  \endcode
 *
 *
 *  @section USING Using customized setting files
 *
 *  It is possible to use customized settings files for the test run instead of testing SCIP with default settings.
 *  These have to be placed in the directory <code>scip/settings/</code>.
 *
 *  @b Note: Accessing setting files in subfolders of the @c settings directory is currently not supported.
 *
 *  To run SCIP with a custom settings file, say for example <code>fast.set</code>, we call
 *
 *  \code
 *  make TEST=testrun SETTINGS=fast test
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  in the SCIP root directory.
 *
 *
 *  @section ADVANCED Advanced options
 *
 *  We can further customize the test run by specifying the following options in the <code>make</code> call:
 *
 *  \arg <code>TIME</code>  - time limit for each test instance in seconds [default: 3600]
 *  \arg <code>NODES</code> - node limit [default: 2100000000]
 *  \arg <code>MEM</code>   -  memory limit in MB [default: 1536]
 *  \arg <code>DISPFREQ</code> - display frequency of the output [default: 10000]
 *  \arg <code>FEASTOL</code> - LP feasibility tolerance for constraints [default: "default"]
 *  \arg <code>LOCK</code> - should the test run be locked to prevent other machines from performing the same test run [default: "false"]
 *  \arg <code>CONTINUE</code> - continue the test run if it was previously aborted [default: "false"]
 *  \arg <code>VALGRIND</code> - run valgrind on the SCIP binary; errors and memory leaks found by valgrind are reported as fails [default: "false"]
 *
 *
 *  @section COMPARE Comparing test runs for different settings
 *
 *  Often test runs are performed on the basis of different settings. In this case, it is useful to
 *  have a performance comparison. For this purpose, we can use the <code>allcmpres.sh</code> script in
 *  the @c check directory.
 *
 *  Suppose, we performed our test run with two different settings, say <code>fast.set</code> and
 *  <code>slow.set</code>. Assuming that all other parameters (including the SCIP binary), were the same,
 *  we may have the following <code>res</code>-files in the directory <code>scip/check/results/</code>
 *
 *  \code
 *  check.testrun.scip-1.1.0.linux.x86.gnu.opt.spx.mycomputer.fast.res
 *  check.testrun.scip-1.1.0.linux.x86.gnu.opt.spx.mycomputer.slow.res
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  For a comparison of both computations, we simply call
 *
 *  \code
 *  allcmpres.sh results/check.testrun.scip-1.1.0.linux.x86.gnu.opt.spx.mycomputer.fast.res \
 *               results/check.testrun.scip-1.1.0.linux.x86.gnu.opt.spx.mycomputer.slow.res
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  in the @c check directory. This produces an ASCII table on the console that provide a detailed
 *  performance comparison of both test runs. Note that the first <code>res</code>-file serves as reference
 *  computation. The following list explains the output.
 *  (The term "solver" can be considered as the combination of SCIP with a specific setting file.)
 *
 *  \arg <code>Nodes</code> - Number of processed branch-and-bound nodes.
 *  \arg <code>Time</code>  - Computation time in seconds.
 *  \arg <code>F</code>     - If no feasible solution was found, then '#', empty otherwise.
 *  \arg <code>NodQ</code>  - Equals Nodes(i) / Nodes(0), where 'i' denotes the current solver and '0' stands for the reference solver.
 *  \arg <code>TimQ</code>  - Equals Time(i) / Time(0).
 *  \arg <code>bounds check</code> - Status of the primal and dual bound check.
 *
 *  \arg <code>proc</code> - Number of instances processed.
 *  \arg <code>eval</code> - Number of instances evaluated (bounds check = "ok", i.e., solved to optimality
 *      within the time and memory limit and result is correct). Only these instances are used in the calculation
 *      of the mean values.
 *  \arg <code>fail</code> - Number of instances with bounds check = "fail".
 *  \arg <code>time</code> - Number of instances with timeout.
 *  \arg <code>solv</code> - Number of instances correctly solved within the time limit.
 *  \arg <code>wins</code> - Number of instances on which the solver won (i.e., the
 *      solver was at most 10% slower than the fastest solver OR had the best
 * 	primal bound in case the instance was not solved by any solver within
 *	the time limit).
 *  \arg <code>bett</code>    - Number of instances on which the solver was better than the
 *	reference solver (i.e., more than 10% faster).
 *  \arg <code>wors</code>    - Number of instances on which the solver was worse than the
 *	reference solver (i.e., more than 10% slower).
 *  \arg <code>bobj</code>    - Number of instances on which the solver had a better primal
 *	bound than the reference solver (i.e., a difference larger than 10%).
 *  \arg <code>wobj</code>    - Number of instances on which the solver had a worse primal
 *	bound than the reference solver (i.e., a difference larger than 10%).
 *  \arg <code>feas</code>    - Number of instances for which a feasible solution was found.
 *  \arg <code>gnodes</code>   - Geometric mean of the processed nodes over all evaluated instances.
 *  \arg <code>shnodes</code> - Shifted geometric mean of the processed nodes over all evaluated instances.
 *  \arg <code>gnodesQ</code>  - Equals nodes(i) / nodes(0), where 'i' denotes the current
 *	solver and '0' stands for the reference solver.
 *  \arg <code>shnodesQ</code> - Equals shnodes(i) / shnodes(0).
 *  \arg <code>gtime</code>    - Geometric mean of the computation time over all evaluated instances.
 *  \arg <code>shtime</code>  - Shifted geometric mean of the computation time over all evaluated instances.
 *  \arg <code>gtimeQ</code>   - Equals time(i) / time(0).
 *  \arg <code>shtimeQ</code> - Equals shtime(i) / shtime(0).
 *  \arg <code>score</code>   - N/A
 *
 *  \arg <code>all</code>   - All solvers.
 *  \arg <code>optimal auto settings</code> - Theoretical result for a solver that performed 'best of all' for every instance.
 *  \arg <code>diff</code>  - Solvers with instances that differ from the reference solver in the number of
 *       processed nodes or in the total number of simplex iterations.
 *  \arg <code>equal</code> - Solvers with instances whose number of processed nodes and total number of
 *       simplex iterations is equal to the reference solver (including a 10% tolerance) and where no timeout
 *       occured.
 *  \arg <code>all optimal</code> - Solvers with instances that could be solved to optimality by
 *       <em>all</em> solvers; in particular, no timeout occurred.
 *
 *  Since this large amount of information is not always needed, one can generate a narrower table by calling:
 *  \code
 *  allcmpres.sh short=1 ...
 *  \endcode
 *  where <code>NodQ</code>, <code>TimQ</code> and the additional comparison tables are omitted.
 *
 *  If the <code>res</code>-files were generated with the parameter <code>printsoltimes=1</code>
 *  we can enable the same feature here as well by calling:
 *  \code
 *  allcmpres.sh printsoltimes=1 ...
 *  \endcode
 *  As in the evaluation, the output contains the two additional columns of the solving time until the first and the best solution was found.
 *
 *  @section SOLVER Testing and Evaluating for other solvers
 *
 *  Analogously to the target <code>test</code> there are further targets to run automated tests with other MIP solvers.
 *  These are:
 *  \arg for <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/">cplex</a>
 *  \code
 *  make testcplex
 *  \endcode
 *  \arg for <a href="http://www.gurobi.com/">gurobi</a>
 *  \code
 *  make testgurobi
 *  \endcode
 *  \arg for <a href="http://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc">cbc</a>
 *  \code
 *  make testcbc
 *  \endcode
 *  \arg for <a href="http://www.mosek.com/">mosek</a>
 *  \code
 *  make testmosek
 *  \endcode
 *  \arg for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/">glpk</a>
 *  \code
 *  make testglpk
 *  \endcode
 *  \arg for <a href="http://projects.coin-or.org/SYMPHONY">symphony</a>
 *  \code
 *  make testsymphony
 *  \endcode
 *  \arg for <a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/CHiPPS">blis</a>
 *  \code
 *  make testblis
 *  \endcode
 *  \arg for <a href="http://www.gams.com/">gams</a>
 *  \code
 *  make testgams GAMSSOLVER=xyz
 *  \endcode
 *  For this target, the option GAMSSOLVER has to be given to specify the name of a GAMS solver to run, e.g. GAMSSOLVER=SCIP.
 *  Additional advanced options specific to this target are:
 *    GAMS to specify the GAMS executable (default: gams),
 *    GAP to specify a gap limit (default: 0.0),
 *    SCRDIR to specify a directory where GAMS should put its scratch files (default: gams decides),
 *    CONVERTSCIP to specify a SCIP which can be used to convert non-gams files into gams format (default: bin/scip, if existing; set to "no" to disable conversion).
 *  The following options are NOT supported (and ignored): MEM, DISPFREQ, FEASTOL, LOCK.
 *
 *  Note: This works only if the referred programs are installed globally on your machine.
 *
 *  The above options like <code>TIME</code> are also available for the other solvers.
 *
 *  For cbc, cplex, gams, and gurobi another advanced option is available:
 *  \arg <code>THREADS</code> - number of threads used in the solution process
 *
 *  After the testrun there should be an <code>.out</code>, an <code>.err</code> and a <code>.res</code> file
 *  with the same basename as described above.
 *
 *  Furthermore you can also use the script <code>allcmpres.sh</code> for comparing results of different solvers.

/**@page CHG2 Interface changes between SCIP 1.0 and SCIP 1.1
 *
 * - SCIPcreateChild() has a new last parameter giving an estimate for value of best feasible solution in the subtree to
 *   be created. One possibility is to use SCIPgetLocalOrigEstimate() for this value.
 *
 * - The callback \ref CONSCHECK in the constraint handlers now has a new parameter <code>printreason</code> that tells
 *   a constraint handler to output the reason for a possible infeasibility of the solution to be checked using
 *   SCIPinfoMessage(). Have a look at one of the constraint handlers implemented in SCIP to see how it works. This
 *   methodology makes it possible to output the reason of a violation in human readable form, for instance, for the check
 *   at the end of a SCIP run, where the obtained best solution is checked against the original formulation.\n This change
 *   often has little effect on C-implementations, since this parameter can be safely ignored with respect to the
 *   correctness of the code. The corresponding C++ method scip::ObjConshdlr::scip_check(), however, has to be extended
 *   and will not compile otherwise.
 *
 * - SCIPcheckSolOrig() is restructured. The last two parameters have changed. They are now bools indicating
 *   whether the reason for the violation should be printed to the standard output and whether all violations should be
 *   printed. This reflects the changes in the constraint handlers above, which allow the automation of the feasibility
 *   test. The pointers to store the constraint handler or constraint are not needed anymore.
 *
 * - New parameters "extension" and "genericnames" in SCIPprintTransProblem(), SCIPprintOrigProblem(),
 *   SCIPwriteOrigProblem(), and SCIPwriteTransProblem() defining the requested format or NULL for default CIP format
 *   and using generic names for the variables and constraints. Examples are
 *   - <code>SCIPprintTransProblem(scip, NULL, NULL, TRUE)</code> displays the transformed problem in CIP format with
 *     generic variables and constraint names
 *   - <code>SCIPprintOrigProblem(scip, NULL, "lp", FALSE)</code> displays the original problem in LP format with
 *     original variables and constraint names.
 *
 * - New callback method SCIP_DECL_READERWRITE(x) in type_reader.h; this method is called to write a problem to file
 *   stream in the format the reader stands for; useful for writing the transformed problem in LP or MPS format. Hence,
 *   also SCIPincludeReader() has changed.
 *
 * - New parameter "conshdlrname" in SCIPincludeLinconsUpgrade().
 *
 * - Added user pointer to callback methods of hash table, see pub_misc.h.
 *
 * - New parameter "extension" in SCIPreadProb(),    defining a desired file format or NULL if file extension should be used.

/**@page CHG3 Interface changes between SCIP 1.1 and SCIP 1.2
 *
 *
 * @section CHGCALLBACKS New and changed callbacks
 *
 * - The callback SCIP_DECL_PRICERREDCOST(x) in the \ref PRICER "pricers" has two new parameters:
 *    - A <code>result</code> pointer determines whether the pricer guarantees that there exist no more variables. This allows for early branching.
 *    - A pointer for providing a lower bound.
 *
 * - The \ref CONS "constraint handlers" have two new callback methods (see type_cons.h for more details).
 *    - SCIP_DECL_CONSCOPY(x) - this method can be used to copy a constraint.
 *    - SCIP_DECL_CONSPARSE(x) - this method can be used to parse a constraint in CIP format.
 *
 *  @section CHGINTERFUNC New parameters in interface methods
 *
 * - SCIPcalcMIR() in scip.h has two new parameter "mksetcoefsvalid" and "sol". The parameter "mksetcoefsvalid" stores
 *   whether the coefficients of the mixed knapsack set ("mksetcoefs") computed in SCIPlpCalcMIR() are valid. If the mixed knapsack constraint obtained after aggregating LP rows
 *   is empty or contains too many nonzero elements the generation of the <b>c-MIR cut</b> is aborted in SCIPlpCalcMIR() and "mksetcoefs" is not valid.

/**@page CHG4 Interface changes between SCIP 1.2 and SCIP 2.0
 *
 *
 * @section CHGCALLBACKS4 New and changed callbacks
 *
 *
 * - <b>Copying a SCIP instance</b>:
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - All plugins, like \ref BRANCH "branching rules" and \ref HEUR "primal heuristics", have a new callback method (see, e.g.,
 *      type_branch.h and type_heur.h for more details):
 *       - SCIP_DECL_BRANCHCOPY(x), SCIP_DECL_HEURCOPY(x) etc.
 *       - When copying a SCIP instance, these methods are called to copy the plugins.
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - Constraint handlers have two new callback methods. One for copying the constraint handler plugins
 *      SCIP_DECL_CONSHDLRCOPY() and the other for copying a constraint itself, SCIP_DECL_CONSCOPY().
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - Variables have a new callback method (see type_var.h for more details):
 *       - SCIP_DECL_VARCOPY(x) - When copying a SCIP instance, this method is called to copy the variables' data.
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - The main problem has a new callback method (see type_prob.h for more details):
 *       - SCIP_DECL_PROBCOPY(x) - When copying a SCIP instance, this method is called to copy the problem's data.
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - The argument success in SCIP_DECL_CONSCOPY has been renamed to valid.
 *
 * - <b>Branching on externally given candidates</b>:
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - The \ref BRANCH "branching rules" have a second new callback method (see type_branch.h for more details):
 *       - SCIP_DECL_BRANCHEXECEXT(x) - This method can be used to branch on external branching candidates,
 *         which can be added by a user's "relaxation handler" or "constraint handler" plugin, calling <code>SCIPaddExternBranchCand()</code>.
 *
 * - <b>Restarts</b>:
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - The callback SCIP_DECL_PROBEXITSOL(x) in the main problem has one new parameter (see type_prob.h for more details):
 *       - The parameter <code>restart</code> is <code>TRUE</code> if the callback method was triggered by a restart.
 *
 *
 * <br>
 * @section CHGINTERFUNC4 Changed interface methods
 *
 * - <b>Copying a SCIP instance</b>:
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - Every new callback method resulted in a new parameter of the include function for the corresponding plugin,
 *      e.g., SCIPincludeBranchrule() has two new parameters <code>SCIP_DECL_BRANCHCOPY((*branchcopy))</code> and
 *      <code>SCIP_DECL_BRANCHEXECREL((*branchexecrel))</code>.  In the same fashion, the new callbacks
 *      SCIP_DECL_VARCOPY and SCIP_DECL_PROBCOPY led to new parameters in SCIPcreateVar() and SCIPcreateProb() in
 *      scip.c, respectively.
 *      <br><br>
 *    - SCIPincludeHeur() and SCIPincludeSepa() in \ref scip.h, as well as scip::ObjSepa() and scip::ObjHeur(), have a new parameter:
 *       - <code>usessubscip</code> - It can be used to inform SCIP that the heuristic/separator to be included uses a secondary SCIP instance.
 *      <br><br>
 *    - SCIPapplyRens() in \ref heur_rens.h has a new parameter <code>uselprows</code>. It can be used to switch from LP rows
 *      to constraints as basis of the sub-SCIP constructed in the RENS heuristic.
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - W.r.t. to copy and the C++ wrapper classes there are two new classes. These are <code>ObjCloneable</code> and
 *      <code>ObjProbCloneable</code>. The constraint handlers and variables pricers are derived from
 *      <code>ObjProbCloneable</code> and all other plugin are derived from <code>ObjCloneable</code>. Both
 *      classes implement the function <code>iscloneable()</code> which return whether a plugin is clone
 *      able or not. Besides that
 *      each class has a function named <code>clone()</code> which differ in their signature.
 *      See objcloneable.h, objprobcloneable.h, and the TSP example for more details.
 *
 * - <b>Branching</b>:
 *      <br><br>
 *    - The method SCIPgetVarStrongbranch() has been replaced by two methods SCIPgetVarStrongbranchFrac() and
 *      SCIPgetVarStrongbranchInt().
 *      <br><br>
 *    - The methods SCIPgetVarPseudocost() and SCIPgetVarPseudocostCurrentRun() in \ref scip.h now return the pseudocost value of
 *      one branching direction, scaled to a unit interval. The former versions of SCIPgetVarPseudocost() and
 *      SCIPgetVarPseudocostCurrentRun() are now called SCIPgetVarPseudocostVal() and SCIPgetVarPseudocostValCurrentRun(), respectively.
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - The methods SCIPgetVarConflictScore() and SCIPgetVarConflictScoreCurrentRun() in \ref scip.h are now called
 *      SCIPgetVarVSIDS() and SCIPgetVarVSIDSCurrentRun(), respectively.
 *      <br><br>
 *    - The methods SCIPvarGetNInferences(), SCIPvarGetNInferencesCurrentRun(), SCIPvarGetNCutoffs(), and
 *      SCIPvarGetNCutoffsCurrentRun() are now called SCIPvarGetInferenceSum(), SCIPvarGetInferenceSumCurrentRun(),
 *      SCIPvarGetCutoffSum(), and SCIPvarGetCutoffSumCurrentRun(), respectively. Furthermore, they now return
 *      <code>SCIP_Real</code> instead of <code>SCIP_Longint</code> values.
 *
 * - <b>Others</b>:
 *      <br><br>
 *    - SCIPcutGenerationHeuristicCmir() in \ref sepa_cmir.h has three new parameters:
 *        - <code>maxmksetcoefs</code> - If the mixed knapsack constraint obtained after aggregating LP rows contains more
 *          than <code>maxmksetcoefs</code> nonzero coefficients the generation of the <b>c-MIR cut</b> is aborted.
 *        - <code>delta</code> - It can be used to obtain the scaling factor which leads to the best c-MIR cut found within
 *          the cut generation heuristic. If a <code>NULL</code> pointer is passed, the corresponding c-MIR cut will already be
 *          added to SCIP by SCIPcutGenerationHeuristicCmir(). Otherwise, the user can generate the cut and add it to SCIP
 *          on demand afterwards.
 *        - <code>deltavalid</code> - In case, the user wants to know the best scaling factor, i.e., <code>delta</code> passed is not <code>NULL</code>,
 *          <code>deltavalid</code> will be <code>TRUE</code> if the stored scaling factor <code>delta</code> will lead to a violated c-MIR cut.
 *      <br>
 *      <br>
 *    - All functions for setting <b>user parameters</b> of different types like SCIPparamSetBool(), SCIPparamSetChar(),
 *      SCIPparamSetInt(), SCIPparamSetLongint(), and SCIPparamSetString() in pub_paramset.h have a new parameter:
 *        - <code>quiet</code> - It prevents any output during the assign to a new value.
 *
 * <br>
 * @section MISCELLANEOUS4 Miscellaneous
 *
 * - The NLPI library is now a separate library that is required when linking against the SCIP library.
 *   This requires changes to Makefiles that use SCIP, see the \ref RELEASENOTES "Release notes" for more details.
 *
 * - We do not distinguish between <b>block memory</b> for the original and the transformed problem anymore. The same
 *   block memory is now used in both problem stages.
 *
 * - The usage of <b>strong branching</b> changed. Now, SCIPstartStrongbranch() and SCIPendStrongbranch() must be
 *   called before and after strong branching, respectively.
 *
 * - All <b>C++</b> objects and constructors have a SCIP pointer, now.
 *
 * - The <b>predefined setting files</b> like "settings/cuts/off.set,aggressive.set,fast.set" have been replaced by
 *   interface methods like SCIPsetHeuristics(), SCIPsetPresolving(), SCIPsetSeparating(), and SCIPsetEmphasis() in
 *   \ref scip.h and by user dialogs in the interactive shell like
 *   <br>
 *   <br>
 *   <code>SCIP&gt; set {heuristics|presolving|separating} emphasis {aggressive|fast|off}</code>
 *   <br>
 *   <br>
 *   or
 *   <br>
 *   <br>
 *   <code>SCIP&gt; set emphasis {counter|cpsolver|easycip|feasibility|hardlp|optimality}</code>
 *

  *      <br>
  *    - The new parameters "nnewaddconss" and "naddconss" were added to the constraint handler callback method SCIP_DECL_CONSPRESOL()
  *      and the presolver callback method SCIP_DECL_PRESOLEXEC(). These parameters were also added to corresponding C++ wrapper class methods.
  *    - Propagators are now also called in during presolving, this is supported by the new callback methods SCIP_DECL_PROPINITPRE(),
  *      SCIP_DECL_PROPEXITPRE(), and SCIP_DECL_PROPPRESOL().
  *    - New parameters "isunbounded" and "isinfeasible" for presolving initialization (SCIP_DECL_CONSINITPRE(),

  *      SCIP_DECL_PRESOLEXITPRE(), SCIP_DECL_PROPEXITPRE()) callbacks of presolvers,
  *      constraint handlers and propagators, telling the callback whether the problem was already declared to be
  *      unbounded or infeasible.  This allows to avoid expensive steps in these methods in case the problem is already
  *      solved, anyway.
  *      <br>
  *      <br>
  *      <DIV class="note">
  *      Note, that the C++ methods
  *      - scip::ObjConshdlr::scip_presol() corresponding to SCIP_DECL_CONSPRESOL()
  *      - scip::ObjConshdlr::scip_initpre() corresponding to  SCIP_DECL_CONSINITPRE()

  *      are virtual functions. That means, if you are not adding the new parameters, your code will still compile, but these methods are not executed.
  *      </DIV>
  *
  * - <b>Constraint Handler</b>:
  *     <br>
  *     <br>
  *   - The new constraint handler callback SCIP_DECL_CONSDELVARS() is called after variables were marked for deletion.
  *     This method is optinal and only of interest if you are using SCIP as a branch-and-price framework. That means,
  *     you are generating new variables during the search. If you are not doing that just define the function pointer
  *     to be NULL.
  *     <br>
  *     If this method gets implemented you should iterate over all constraints of the constraint handler and delete all
  *     variables that were marked for deletion by SCIPdelVar().
  *
  * - <b>Problem Data</b>:
  *     <br>
  *     <br>
  *   - The method SCIPcopyProb() and the callback SCIP_DECL_PROBCOPY() got a new parameter "global" to indicate whether the global problem or a local version is copied.
  *
  * - <b>Conflict Analysis</b>:

  *
  * <br>
  * @section CHGINTERFUNC5 Changed interface methods
  *
  * - <b>Writing and Parsing constraints</b>:
  *      <br>
  *      <br>
  *    - The methods SCIPwriteVarName(), SCIPwriteVarsList(), and SCIPwriteVarsLinearsum() got a new boolean parameter "type"
  *      that indicates whether the variable type should be written or not.
  *    - The method SCIPwriteVarsList() got additionally a new parameter "delimiter" that defines the character which is used for delimitation.
  *    - The methods SCIPparseVarName() and SCIPparseVarsList() got a new output parameter "endptr" that is filled with the position where the parsing stopped.
  *
  * - <b>Plugin management</b>:
  *      <br>
  *      <br>
  *    - SCIPincludeProp() got additional parameters to set the timing mask of the propagator and the new callbacks and parameters related to calling the propagator in presolving.

  *      <br>
  *    - Method SCIPseparateRelaxedKnapsack() in knapsack constraint handler got new parameter "cutoff", which is a pointer to store whether a cutoff was found.
  *    - Method SCIPincludeQuadconsUpgrade() of quadratic constraint handler got new parameter "active" to indicate whether the upgrading method is active by default.
  *
  * - <b>Nonlinear expressions, relaxation, and solver interface</b>:
  *      <br>
  *      <br>
  *    - The methods SCIPexprtreeEvalSol(), SCIPexprtreeEvalIntLocalBounds(), and SCIPexprtreeEvalIntGlobalBounds() have been renamed to SCIPevalExprtreeSol(),
  *      SCIPevalExprtreeLocalBounds(), and SCIPevalExprtreeGlobalBounds() and are now located in scip.h.
  *    - Various types and functions dealing with polynomial expressions have been renamed to use the proper terms "monomial" and "polynomial".
  *    - The methods SCIPnlpGetObjective(), SCIPnlpGetSolVals(), and SCIPnlpGetVarSolVal() have been removed, use SCIPgetNLPObjval(), SCIPvarGetNLPSol()
  *      and SCIPcreateNLPSol() to retrieve NLP solution values instead.
  *    - Removed methods SCIPmarkRequireNLP() and SCIPisNLPRequired(), because the NLP is now always constructed if nonlinearities are present.
  *    - SCIPgetNLP() has been removed and NLP-methods from pub_nlp.h have been moved to scip.h, which resulted in some renamings, too.

  *    - SCIPdelVar() got a new parameter "deleted", which stores whether the variable was successfully marked to be deleted.
  *    - SCIPcalcNodeselPriority() got a new parameter "branchdir", which defines the type of branching that was performed: upwards, downwards, or fixed.
  *    - The parameters "timelimit" and "memorylimit" were removed from SCIPapplyRens().
  *
  * <br>
  * @section MISCELLANEOUS5 Miscellaneous
  *
  *  - The result value SCIP_NEWROUND has been added, it allows a separator/constraint handler to start a new separation round
  *    (without previous calls to other separators/conshdlrs).
  *  - All timing flags are now defined type_timing.h.
  *  - The variable deletion event is now a variable specific event and not global, anymore.
  *  - The emphasis setting types now distinguish between plugin-type specific parameter settings (default, aggressive, fast, off), which are changed by

/**@page COUNTER How to use SCIP to count/enumerate feasible solutions
 *
 * SCIP is capable of computing (count or enumerate) the number of feasible solutions of a given constraint integer
 * program. In case continuous variables are present, the number of feasible solutions for the projection to the
 * integral variables is counted/enumerated. This means, an assignment to the integer variables is counted if the
 * remaining problem (this is the one after fixing the integer variables w.r.t. to this assignment) is feasible.
 *
 * As a first step you have to load or create your problem in the usual way. In case of using the
 * interactive shell, you use the <code>read</code> command:
 *
 * <code>SCIP&gt; read &lt;file name&gt;</code>
 *
 * Afterwards you can count the number of feasible solution with the command <code>count</code>.
 *
 * <code>SCIP&gt; count</code>
 *
 * That means SCIP will count the number of solution but does not store (enumerate) them. If you are interested in that see
 * \ref COLLECTALLFEASEBLES.
 *
 * @note Since SCIP version 2.0.0 you do not have to worry about <tt>dual</tt> reductions anymore. These are
 * automatically turned off. The only thing you should switch off are restarts. These restarts can lead to a wrong
 * counting process. We recommend using the counting settings which can be set in the interactive shell as follows:
 *
 * <code>SCIP&gt; set emphasis counter</code>
 *
 * The SCIP callable library provides an interface method SCIPcount() which allows users to count the number of feasible
 * solutions to their problem. The method SCIPsetParamsCountsols(), which is also located in cons_countsols.h, loads the
 * predefined counting settings to ensure a safe count. The complete list of all methods that can be used for counting
 * via the callable library can be found in cons_countsols.h.
 *
 *
 * @section COUNTLIMIT Limit the number of solutions which should be counted
 *
 * It is possible to give a (soft) upper bound on the number solutions that should be counted. If this upper bound is
 * exceeded, SCIP will be stopped. The name of this parameter is <code>constraints/countsols/sollimit</code>. In
 * the interactive shell this parameter can be set as follows:
 *
 * <code>SCIP&gt; set constraints countsols sollimit 1000</code>
 *
 * In case you are using the callable library, this upper bound can be assigned by calling SCIPsetLongintParam() as follows:
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPsetLongintParam( scip, "constraints/countsols/sollimit", 1000) );
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * The reason why this upper bound is soft comes from the fact that, by default, SCIP uses a technique called unrestricted
 * subtree detection. Using this technique it is possible to detect several solutions at once. Therefore, it can happen
 * that the solution limit is exceeded before SCIP is stopped.
 *
 * @section COLLECTALLFEASEBLES Collect all feasible solution
 *
 * Per default SCIP only counts all feasible solutions. This means, these solutions are not stored. If you switch the
 * parameter <code>constraints/countsols/collect</code> to TRUE (the default value is FALSE) the detected solutions are
 * stored. Changing this parameter can be done in the interactive shell
 *
 * <code>SCIP&gt; set constraints countsols collect TRUE</code>
 *
 * as well as via the callable library
 *
 * \code
 * SCIP_CALL( SCIPsetBoolParam( scip, "constraints/countsols/collect", TRUE) );
 * \endcode
 *
 * @note The solution which are collected are stored w.r.t. the active variables. These are the variables which got not
 *       removed during presolving.
 *
 * In case you are using the interactive shell you can write all collected solutions to a file as follows
 *
 * <code>SCIP&gt; write allsolutions &lt;file name&gt;</code>
 *
 * In that case the sparse solutions are unrolled and lifted back into the original variable space.
 *
 * The callable library provides a method which gives access to all collected sparse solutions. That is,
 * SCIPgetCountedSparseSolutions(). The sparse solutions you get are defined w.r.t. active variables. To get solutions
 * w.r.t. to the original variables. You have to do two things:
 *
 * -# unroll each sparse solution
 * -# lift each solution into original variable space by extending the solution by those variable which got removed
 *    during presolving
 *
 * The get the variables which got removed during presolving, you can use the methods SCIPgetFixedVars() and
 * SCIPgetNFixedVars(). The method SCIPgetProbvarLinearSum() transforms given variables, scalars and constant to the
 * corresponding active variables, scalars and constant. Using this method for a single variable gives a representation
 * for that variable w.r.t. the active variables which can be used to compute the value for the considered solution (which
 * is defined w.r.t. active variables).
 *
 * For that complete procedure you can also check the source code of
 * \ref SCIP_DECL_DIALOGEXEC(SCIPdialogExecWriteAllsolutions) "SCIPdialogExecWriteAllsolutions()" cons_countsols.c which
 * does exactly that.
 *
 *
 * @section COUNTOPTIMAL Count number of optimal solutions
 *
 * If you are interested in counting the number of optimal solutions, this can be done with SCIP using the
 * <code>count</code> command by applying the following steps:
 *
 *  -# Solve the original problem to optimality and let \f$c^*\f$ be the optimal value
 *  -# Add the objective function as constraint with left and right hand side equal to \f$c^*\f$
 *  -# load the adjusted problem into SCIP
 *  -# use the predefined counting settings
 *  -# start counting the number of feasible solutions
 *
 * If you do this, SCIP will collect all optimal solutions of the original problem.

 * public and, therefore, allowed to be used. The <a href="../html_devel/index.html">Developer's Manual</a> includes
 * all methods.
 *
 * All of the headers listed below include functions that are allowed to be called by external users. Besides those
 * functions it is also valid to call methods that are listed in one of the headers of the (default) plugins, e.g.,
 * cons_linear.h.
 *
 * If you are looking for information about a particular object of SCIP, such as a variable or a constraint, you should
 * first search the corresponding "pub_<...>.h" header. E.g., for constraints, look in pub_cons.h. If you need some
 * information about the overall problem, you should start searching in scip.h.
 *
 * Since there are a huge number of methods in scip.h, these methods are grouped into different categories. These
 * categories are:
 *
 * - Memory Management
 * - Miscellaneous Methods
 * - General SCIP Methods
 * - Message Output Methods
 * - Parameter Methods
 * - SCIP User Functionality Methods: Managing Plugins
 * - User Interactive Dialog Methods
 * - Global Problem Methods
 * - Local Subproblem Methods
 * - Solve Methods
 * - Variable Methods
 * - Conflict Analysis Methods
 * - Constraint Methods
 * - LP Methods
 * - LP Column Methods
 * - LP Row Methods
 * - Cutting Plane Methods
 * - LP Diving Methods
 * - Probing Methods
 * - Branching Methods
 * - Primal Solution Methods
 * - Event Methods
 * - Tree Methods
 * - Statistic Methods
 * - Timing Methods
 * - Numerical Methods
 * - Dynamic Arrays
