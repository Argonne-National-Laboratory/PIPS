SCIP version 2.1.1
===============

performance improvements:
- revised pseudo objective propagator
- improve SCIPintervalSolveBivariateQuadExpressionAllScalar for ax=0 case if x has 0 in the interval for the linear coef.
- better domain propagation for quadratic constraints that consist of "non-overlapping" bilinear terms only
- ensure that a fixing of a variable in an abspower constraint is propagated to a fixing of the other variable

features:
- the pseudo objective propagator can be forced to propagate if active pricers are present; this can be done 
  if for all (known or unknown) variables follows that: they have positive (negative) objective coefficient 
  and the global lower (upper) bound is zero.

fixed bugs:
- fixed bug in reader_mps.c: INTEND marker is now also written, if COLUMNS section ends with non-continous variables
- fixed numeric issue in aggregations
- fixed pseudo cost computation
- pseudo objective propagator does not propagate it active pricers are present

- fixed bug in cons_bounddisjunction with uninitialized return values
- fixed bug with setting type of slack variables to be implicitly integral
- fixed bug when copying problem data in c++ case returned with the result SCIP_DIDNOTRUN
- fixed computation of counter which state the changes since the last call of a presolver
- fixed handling of unbounded solutions, including double-checking their feasibility and that the primal ray is a
  valid unboundedness proof and reoptimizing the LP with modified settings if the solution is not feasible
- fixed bug in cons_orbitope with calling conflict analysis
- fixed bug in flatzinc reader w.r.t. boolean expressions
- fixed bug in nlpi_oracle w.r.t. changing linear coefs in a NLP constraint
- fixed compilation issues with negate() function in intervalarith.c on exotic platforms
- gams writer now also substitutes $-sign from variable/equation names
- fixed bug in SCIPsortedvecDelPos...() templates
- fixed bug in heur_shiftandpropagate.c concerning the treatment of unbounded variables

parameters:
- changed parameter "propagating/pseudoobj/maxcands" to "propagating/pseudoobj/minuseless" (see prop_pseudoobj.c)
  due to revision of the pseudo objective propagator
- added parameters "heuristics/undercover/fixingorder"

- added parameter <constraints/quadratic/checkfactorable> to disable check for factorable quadratic functions (xAx =
  (ax+b)*(cx+d)) in quadratic constraints and not to use of this information in separation (generates lifted tangent
  inequalities according to Belotti/Miller/Namazifar if also linear vars are present)

  SCIPpropGetNAggrVars, SCIPpropGetNChgVarTypes, SCIPpropGetNChgBds, SCIPpropGetNAddHoles, SCIPpropGetNDelConss,

  SCIPpropDoesPresolve which return corresponding presolving information
- changed computation of optimality gap which is now done in the same way as described in the MIPLIB 2010 paper: the gap
  is 0, if primalbound (pb) and dualbound (db) are equal (within tolerances), it is infinity if pb and db have opposite
  signs, and (this changed), if both have the same sign, the difference between pb and db is devided by the minimum of
  the absolute values of pb and db (instead of always the dual bound)
- new dialog "change freetransproblem" to free transformed problem in the interactive shell before changing the problem
- the knapsack, setppc, and soc constraint handler can now parse their constraints
- new method SCIPintervalPowerScalarInverse() to solve an equation y = x^p for given bounds on y and scalar exponent p
- new method SCIPintervalQuadBivar() to compute tight bounds on a bivariate quadratic form
- new method SCIPintervalSolveBivariateQuadExpressionAllScalar() to compute tight bounds on the solutions of a bivariate
  quadratic equation
- the gams writer can now write nonlinear, abspower, and bivariate constraints
- the pip and zimpl reader now create nonlinear constraints for polynomials of degree > 2
- implement presolving in exitpre() in cons_orbitope and cons_indicator
- implement possibility to force a restart in cons_indicator if enough indicator variables have been fixed
- functionality to use the bound flipping ratio test of SoPlex is available (requires at least version 1.5.0.7)
- there exists now a solution candidate store for the original problem; during transformation these solutions are tried;
  during free the transformed problem the best feasible solution of the transformed problem are copied to the solution
  candidate store of the original problem; this useful if you solve several problems iteratively, solutions get now
  carried over automatically.
- solutions which are given by the user from the outside are now marked by '#' in the output
- implemented possibility to buffer and restore LP solution after diving without having to resolve the LP; currently
  turned off, because performance impact is unclear; controlled by parameters lp/resolverestore and lp/freesolvalbuffers
- reworked concept of lazy bounds: they can now also be used for problems where constraints and objective together
  ensure the bounds; to allow this also for diving heuristics that might change the objective and thus destroy this
  property, lazy bounds are explicitly put into the LP during diving and removed afterwards
- the varbound constraint handler can now parse its constraints
- added beta version of variable deletion: for branch-and-price application, variables can now be completely deleted
  from the problem; variables that are deletable have to be marked with SCIPvarMarkDeletable(), constraint handlers can
  implement the new SCIP_DECL_DELVARS callback that should remove variables from the constraints; at the moment, only
  the linear, the setppc, and the knapsack constraint handler support this callback; furthermore, when using this
  feature, all used plugins have to capture and release variables they store in their data, this is currently only done
  for the aforementioned constraint handlers as well as the and, the varbound, and the logicor constraint handler; for
  more details about this feature, see the FAQ

design:
- SCIP_HASHMAP now works also without block memory
- the probing presolver presol_probing.{c.h} is now a propagator prop_probing.{c,h}, all corresponding parameters moved
  as well
- the redcost separator sepa_redcost.{c.h} is now a propagator prop_redcost.{c,h}, all corresponding parameters moved as
  well
- moved all timings to type_timing.h
- outsourced propAndSolve() method in solve.c which calls domain propagation and solving of the lp and relaxation
- CIP format variable characters defined, e.g. SCIP_VARTYPE_INTEGER_CHAR
- add expression graph data structures and methods for reformulation, domain propagation, and simple convexity check on
  nonlinear expressions

statistic:
- the "Solving Time" is now spitted into presolving, solving, and reading time
- Presolvers section has new column "AddCons" which states the number of added constraint
- Constraints section has new column named "#ResProp" which show the number of resolve propagation calls of certain
  constraint handler
- Constraint Timing section has a new column "ResProp" which states the time spend in resolve propagation method of the
  constraint handler
- new section "Propagator Timing" which shows the time spend in different callbacks of the propagator
- rearranged first two columns of Propagators section; "#Propagate" and "#ResProp" stating the number of call for
  propagation and resolve propagation; the Time column is moved into the new section Propagator Timings
- Constraints section has new column named "MaxNumber" which the maximum number of active constraint of a certain
  constraint handler
- added two columns "Time-0-It" and Calls-0-It" in the LP section which states the number of LP call and time spend for
  solving LPs with zero iterations (only refactorization)

Makefile
- via "PARASCIP=true" as a "Makefile" option it is possible to compile SCIP threadsafe in DEBUG-mode, (in OPT-mode it's
  only necessary if non-default messagehandler or CppAD is used)
- new variable $(INSTALLDIR) in Makefile which define installation directory for the libraries, $(INSTALLDIR)/lib/,
  binary, $(INSTALLDIR)/bin, and include headers, $(INSTALLDIR)/include, the default value is the empty string
- new target in Makefile "install" performs "make" and copies using the install command the include headers, binary, and
  libraries
- new target in Makefile "uninstall" removes libraries, binary, and include headers form INSTALLDIR
- the 'make' parameter 'PARASCIP=true' leads to threadsafe message handlers where you need to call
  SCIPcreateMesshdlrPThreads and SCIPmessageSetHandler/SCIPmessageSetDefaultHandler and SCIPfreeMesshdlrPThreads;
  therefor we need to link with pthread library
- to link against IPOPT, only the base directory of an Ipopt installation need to be specified now; additionally, if
  building with gnu compilers, the Ipopt libraries directory is stored in the SCIP binary, which should make it easier
  to run with Ipopt shared libraries
- new target "make libs" which compiles only the libraries
- to link against Clp, only the base directory of an Clp installation needs to be specified now
- moved *.test and *.solu files to subdirectory testset in check directory and adjusted test scripts
- adjusted all test scripts to use the same new optimality gap computation as in SCIP
- added Makefile option "VALGRIND=true" to enable running the SCIP checks (make test) through valgrind; valgrind errors
  and memory leaks are reported as fails
- removed target "lintfiles", this target is now imitated by the "lint" target and a none empty variable FILES

==================

interface:
- allow access to transformed constraints in SCIP_STAGE_TRANSFORMED

  presolving
- fixed performance issue in presolving w.r.t. to computing the number of new fixings, aggregated, and so on before a

  generation applications
- fixed some bugs w.r.t. to casting pointer arrays
- fixed bug in cons_linear while trying to add a conflict without any variables

- added relaxsol to variables, s.t. a relaxator can store a solution on which branching or separation can be done
- added relaxation structure to SCIP, it represents global relaxation information independent from a specific relaxator;
  at the moment, it contains information about the relaxation solution stored in the variables: objective value and
  validness
- SCIP can now branch on relaxation solutions that are either installed to the relaxsol field of the variables or added
  to the list of relaxation candidates, e.g., by constraint handlers. Branching on relaxation solutions is performed if
  the enforcement resulted in an unresolved infeasibility and there are no LP branching candidates, but before pseudo
  solution branching.  The branching rules leastinf, mostinf, random, and pscost implement the callback for branching on
  relaxation candidates.
- primal heuristics may now already be called before presolving, using the new timing point
  SCIP_HEURTIMING_BEFOREPRESOL.  Note that solutions that are added before/during presolving, will be retransformed to
  the original space.

- "negated cliques" (1<=i<=n : sum (x_i) >= n-1) were added and we are using them now inside the knapsack constraint
  handler, the cliquepartitioning which is returned by SCIPcalcCliquePartition contains now integer != 0, negatives ones
  indicates a negated clique and positive ones indicates a normal clique
- SCIP is now able to detect in DEBUG-mode whether a constraint or variables which will be added, was also created in
  the same scip instance, if not an error is thrown
- added new sorting method SCIPsortRealIntPtr, SCIPsortDownRealIntPtr and all corresponding methods
- the indicator constraint can now decompose the problem, i.e., not add the linear constraint to the problem if all of
  its variables are continuous
- added new dialog for setting heuristics to aggressive, fast, or off in interactive shell
- the vbc visualization adds the branching type (lower or upper bound change) and the new bound to the node information
- following methods SCIPinferVarUbProp, SCIPinferVarLbProp, SCIPinferVarLbCons, SCIPinferVarUbCons have a new 6th
  parameter "SCIP_Bool force" which allows bound tightening even if the difference to the newbound is below bound
  strengthening tolerance
- the vbc visualization adds the new bound of the branched variable to the node information
- allow user to trigger a restart during presolving SCIPrestartSolve()
- SCIPsolveKnapsackExactly got a new 12. parameter "SCIP_Bool* success" which stores if an error occured during
  solving(normally a memory problem)

  will not branch but return "infeasible or unbounded" like in presolving)
- fixed bug in sepa_flowcover.c: numerical issues while computing candidate set for lambda

parameters:
- added parameter <misc/usesmalltables> which results in using smaller tables for names, cliques and cuts and improves
  the performace for smaller instances, default value FALSE
- added parameter <misc/usevartable> and <misc/useconstable> which turns on/off the usage of hashtables mapping from
  variable/constraint names to the variables/constraints; when turned off, SCIPfindVar() and SCIPfindCons() may not be
  used; the hashtables can be turned off for subMIPs to improve the performance, default value TRUE

design:
- removed two different block memories for the original and transformed problem

Makefile
- added target "lintfiles" which allows to call flexelint with a list of file, for example, make lintfiles
  FILES="src/scip/prop_vbounds.c"
- the NLP solver interfaces and expression interpreter are located in a separate library (libnlpi.*; similar to the lpi
  library) and is required to link against the SCIP library also projects that use SCIP via make/make.project need to
  change their Makefile (!!!): in the $(MAINFILE) target, add $(NLPILIBFILE) behind $(LPILIBFILE) in the dependencies
  and add $(LINKCXX_l)$(NLPILIB)$(LINKLIBSUFFIX) to the linker flags


SCIP version 1.2.0
===============

interface:
- new parameter "mksetcoefsvalid" in lp.c: SCIPlpCalcMIR(), scip.c: SCIPcalcMIR(), and sepa_cmir.c: tryDelta() to store
  whether "mksetcoefs" computed in SCIPlpCalcMIR() is valid. If the mixed knapsack constraint obtained after aggregating
  LP rows is empty or contains too many nonzero elements the generation of the c-MIR cut is aborted in SCIPlpCalcMIR()
  and mksetcoefs is not valid.
- new parameter "set" in SCIPconsSetInitial().
- new methods SCIPchgVarLbLazy() and SCIPchgVarUbLazy() in scip.h; These methods can be used to change the lazy lower or
  upper bound of a variable; This might has the consequences that the bounds of the corresponding variable is not in
  LP. This is the case if the lazy lower or upper bound is greater or less than the local lower or upper bound,
  respectively
- new method SCIPvarGetLbLazy() and SCIPvarGetUbLazy() in pub_var.h; These methods return the lazy lower or upper bound,
  respectively

  curr[5~ent (local) number of variables fixed to one/zero in the given setppc constraint
- new methods SCIPprintNodeRootPath() in scip.h This method prints all branching decisions on variables from the root to
  the given node

  methods return the set of variable branchings that were performed in the parent node / all ancestor nodes to create a
  given node

  pendants for the current run
- new method to deactivate a pricer SCIPdeactivatePricer() in scip.c
- new function SCIPsetProbName() to set problem name in scip.h/c (SCIPprobSetName() in prob.h/c)
- new parameters "lowerbound" and "result" in type_pricer.h: lowerbound can save a lower bound computed by the pricer,
  result indicates whether the pricer guarantees that there exist no more variables if no variable was found
- new methods SCIPisLPRelax() and SCIPisRootLPRelax() in scip.c and scip.h returning whether the current/root LP is a
  relaxation of the current/root problem and thus defines a valid lower bound
- new methods SCIPlpSetIsRelax() and SCIPlpSetRootLPIsRelax() in lp.c and lp.h to set the information, whether the lp is
  a valid relaxation; this information is per default set to true and constraint be used. The aggregated version has
  only 2 linear constraints the default linearization has nvars + 1
- added function SCIPgetTransObjscale() and SCIPgetTransObjoffset() in scip.c
- new interface methods SCIPcolSort(), SCIProwSort(), SCIPcolGetIndex()
- extended the sort template functions in sorttpl.c with a "five" array; now it possible to used this template to sort
  up to five arrays
- new callback method SCIP_DECL_CONSCOPY(x) in type_cons.h; this method can be use to copy a constraint
- new callback method SCIP_DECL_CONSPARSE(x) in type_cons.h; this method can be use to pasre a constraint in CIP format
- added function SCIPaddObjoffset() in scip.h; sets offset of objective function

- added function SCIPgetOrigObjscale() in scip.h; returns the objective scale of the original problem
- added function SCIPparseVars() in scip.h; parses variable information (in cip format) out of a string
- added function SCIPparseCons() in scip.h; parses constraint information (in cip format) out of a string
- added function SCIPgetConsCopy() in scip.h; which copies a constraint of the source SCIP
- new parameter "sol" in lp.c: SCIPlpCalcMIR(), scip.c: SCIPcalcMIR(), and sepa_cmir.c: tryDelta() to separate a sol
  different from the LP solution
- new parameter "sol" in scip.c: SCIPgetVarClosestVlb() and SCIPgetVarClosestVub() and var.c: SCIPvarGetClosestVlb() and
  SCIPvarGetClosestVub() to get closest variable bound w.r.t. sol different from LP solution
- new methods in pub_misc.h/misc.c to access hash map lists and elements of a hash map list and to clear all entries in
  a hash map
- some interval arithmetic method take an additional argument to denote which value stands for infinity in an interval
- extend Makefile to link against Ipopt if IPOPT=true is set
- added function SCIPvarsGetProbvarBinary() in pub_var.h; gets active, fixed, or multi-aggregated problem variables of
  binary variables and corresponding negated status
- added SCIPsortPtrPtrLongInt() and corresponding sorting/inserting/deleting methods in pub_misc.h and necessary defines
  in misc.c
- added detectRedundantConstraints() in cons_xor.c and necessary hash-functions for fast pairwise presolving
- added function SCIPvarCompareActiveAndNegated and SCIPvarCompActiveAndNegated in pub_var.h for comparing variables
  negated, active or fixed the same way
- heavily revised mosek interface


features:
- new trivial heuristic: tries zero solution, lower and upper bound solution and some variable lock based fixing
- adjusted hard memory limit to (soft memory limit)*1.1 + 100mb in check.sh, checkcount.sh, check_cplex.sh,
  check_cluster.sh and check_cbc.sh
- new interface to QSopt due to Daniel Espinoza
- new reader for reading and writing FlatZinc models
- new presolving step in cons_knapsack.c, same like "simplifyinequalities" in cons_linear.c
- each variable has now two additional SCIP_Real parameter which define a lazy lower and upper bound; lazy means that
  there exists constraints which implies these (lazy) bounds. If the lazy lower or upper bound is greater or less than
  the local lower or upper bound, respectively, then the corresponding bound is not put into the LP. The bounds are set
  to minus and plus infinity per default which yields the same behavior as before. With the methods SCIPchgVarLbLazy()
  and SCIPchgVarUbLazy() these bounds can be set.  This is of interest if SCIP gets used as a branch-and-price
  framework. Attention! The lazy bounds need to be valid for each feasible LP solution. If the objective function
  implies bounds on the variables for each optimal LP solution, but these bounds may be violated for arbitrary LP
  solutions, these bounds must not be declared lazy!
- added new timing point, SCIP_HEURTIMING_DURINGPRICINGLOOP, for calling heuristics; If this timing point is used the
  corresponding heuristics is called during the pricing loop of variables; we also added this timing point to
  heur_simplerounding.{h,c} which has the effect that a LP solution which satisfies all integrality conditions during
  the pricing loop is detected
- extended hybrid relpscost branching rule by usage of the average length of conflicts a variable appears in
- one can now write indicator constraints in LP-format
- now it's possible to write strings with more than "SCIP_MAXSTRLEN" amount of characters in all message.c functions
- the current/root lp can be marked to be no relaxation of the current/root problem
- "early branching"-functionality added: in a branch-and-price code, the user can stop pricing at a node although there
  may exist variables with negative reduced costs. In this case, the lp-lowerbound will not be used. The pricer has,
  however, the option to return a lower bound.
- the infrastructure for parsing CIP format is set; each constraint handler has now an callback method
  SCIP_DECL_CONSPARSE() (see type_cons.h)
- the infrastructure for copying constraints is set; each constraint handler has now an callback method
  SCIP_DECL_CONSCOPYE() (see type_cons.h)
- all linear type constraint handlers are able to copy constraints using the function SCIPgetConsCopy() in scip.h
- the linear constraint handler is able to parse a string in CIP format and create a corresponding linear constraint
- interval arithmetic functions can work with unbounded intervals added new functions to allow more operations on
  intervals, including solving quadratic interval equations
- added new preprocessing step (mergeMultiples) in cons_setppc.c where equal variables are merged
- can now run lexicographical dual algorithm (parameter lp/lexdualalgo)
- the indicator constraint can now try to produce a feasible solution (via heur_trysol)
- added new version of zerohalf cuts from Manuel Kutschka

performance improvements:

- removed changing of update rule to "ETA" from standard soplex update "Forrest-Tomlin" in lpi_spx.cpp
- improved memory usage in heur_octane.c
- improved reading time of opb-files, due to using a hashtable for all "and"-constraints
- improved pairwise presolving in cons_and.c due to using a hashtable
- improved performance of merging variables in mergeMultiples() in cons_knapsack.c
- improved performance in tightenWeightsLift() and SCIPseparateRelaxedKnapsack() in cons_knapsack.c, due to now
  sparse-cleaning "global" arrays instead of using BMSclearMemory... functions for cleaning local arrays each time
- improved performance in SCIPcliquelistRemoveFromCliques()
- improved performance in SCIPcalcCliquePartition()
- improved performance in SCIPvarGetActiveRepresentatives() in var.c
- improved pairwise presolving in cons_xor.c due to using a hashtable

fixed bugs:
- fixed bug in SCIPlpSolveAndEval(): if fastmip and pricers enabled and objlimit was reached but CPLEX did not perform
  the final pivot step in order to exceed the objlimit, do one additional simplex step with pricing strategy steepest
  edge, if this doesn't suffice, turn off fastmip temporarily and solve again. Also consider solstat of the new
  solution.
- corrected two asserts in sepa_redcost.c (reduced costs can be negative for fixed variables - qsopt uses this)
- corrected several bugs in the Clp-interface concerning return values
- corrected bug in reader_lp.c: earlier read bounds were thrown away (implementation was not conforming to standard)
- fixed potential interface bug: time limits of 0.0 are not anymore passed to the LP solver, which may have caused
  errors
- fixed wrong result in check.awk, if infeasible problems are stopped in presolving
- fixed wrong use of pointer in lp.c
- fixed memory error in cons_countsols.c
- fixed bug in SCIPsolveNode() concerning the case that the time limit was hit while solving the LP relaxation of a
  subproblem which is already an LP (branching on pseudo solution is not possible)
- fixed wrong fixing of reading bug which was in real a writing bug in MPS format; integer variables in mps format
  without bounds are binary variables, if the bound of an integer variable is infinity you have to write this bound
- fixed bug in chgRhs() and chgLhs() of cons_linear.c: after changing lhs or rhs of a constraints lhs <= rhs has to be
  satisfied without numerical tolerances
- fixed bug in sepa_zerohalf.c; replacement of own sorting functions by template functions was incorrect
- fixed bug in sepa_cmir.c concerning uninitialized mksetcoefs (if MIR-cut generation is aborted because the aggregated
  constraint is empty or contains too many nonzero elements mksetcoefs is invalid)
- fixed bug in SCIPconsSetInitial() that occurred in pairwise presolving: add or delete constraint in initconss when
  changing the initial flag
- fixed "GGT-Kaibel-Bug" in var.c, prop_pseudoobj.c and cons_varbound.c that occured while computing new values using
  infinity values
- fixed assert in cons_and.c method SCIP_DECL_CONSINITSOL(consInitsolAnd)

- cons_countsols.c is now able to store the collected solution if required
- check.awk now uses TeX package supertabular which supports automatic pagebreak
- struct SCIP_Stat has now two additional variables: nprobboundchgs, nprobholechgs; these are used to fix the domain

  constraints instead of pointer copies of the consdata (as explained in the constraint handler "HowTo")

- fixed obvious bug in linear constraint data sorting. Most part of the code assumed pure index sorting, but in fact, it
  was sorted by variable type as first criterion and index as second criterion.

SCIP version 0.90
=================

compiling:
- added ncurses to the readline entries in the make/make.* files
- added quotes to sed expressions in Makefile (needed under Windows)
- modified makefiles for Windows/Intel
- added automatic query script in the Makefile for soft-link names

interface:

- new method SCIPgetVerbLevel()
- slightly changed the meaning of the result codes returned by external relaxators: if they modify the LP or tighten
  bounds of variables, they are not automatically be called again (it is assumed that they already made use of these
  changes). They are only called again, if they returned SCIP_SUSPENDED or if some other plugin modified the LP.
- new parameter "escapecommand" for SCIPdialoghdlrAddHistory()
- new method SCIPescapeString()
- renamed all occurences of "removeable" by the correct English word "removable": SCIPconsIsRemovable(),

  SCIPcreateConsVarbound(), SCIPcreateConsXor(), SCIPcreateConsSetpart(), SCIPcreateConsSetpack(),
  SCIPcreateConsSetcover(): usually, you should set this to FALSE; if you want to add constraints as node markers with
  node data and, e.g., use the "activate" and "deactivate" callbacks to get informed about the activation and
  deactivation of the node, you should set this flag to TRUE in order to make sure, that the constraint will always be
  associated to the node and not moved to a more global node if this would be possible
- removed method SCIPgetVarData(); use SCIPvarGetData() from pub_var.h instead
- replaced callback parameter "inlploop" and "inplunging" by "heurtiming" in SCIP_DECL_HEUREXEC
- replaced parameters "pseudonodes", "duringplunging", "duringlploop", and "afternode" by "timingmask" in
  SCIPincludeHeur() and constructor of ObjHeur() class use the following table to translate old settings into the new
  timingmask:

  value is outside of the current bounds
- new methods SCIPgetGlobalCutpool(), SCIPgetPoolCuts(), SCIPcutpoolGetCuts(), SCIPcutGetRow(), and SCIPcutGetAge()
- slightly changed semantics of SCIPaddConsNode() and SCIPaddConsLocal(), such that a constraint which is added to the
  root node now enters the global problem (and is still existing after a restart)
- new methods SCIPconsGetNLocksPos() and SCIPconsGetNLocksNeg()

plugins:
- new primal heuristic "rens"
- new primal heuristic "mutation"
- slightly modified crossover and rins heuristics
- improved presolving of and, or, and xor constraints
- improved performance of intdiving heuristic
- new primal heuristic "veclendiving"
- improved heuristic "octane"
- improved heuristic "shifting"
- slightly modified rens and localbranching heuristics

  of the current incumbent solution instead of the average of all primal feasible solutions)
- modified c-MIR cut separator to more closely resemble the original version of Marchand and Wolsey
- implemented additional dual presolving in linear constraint handler
- slightly modified presolving of varbound constraint handler

parameters:

- changed default value of "heuristics/octane/freq" to -1 in order to deactivate Octane
- new parameter "separating/cmir/aggrtol"
- new parameter "separating/cmir/fixintegralrhs"
- new parameter "separating/cmir/densityscore"
- new parameter "separating/maxruns"
- new parameters "conflict/restartnum" and "conflict/restartfac"
- parameter "heuristics/feaspump/maxsols" is now strict, i.e., if n solutions were already found, the feasibility pump
  starts to work only if maxsols <= n, instead of maxsols < n
- new parameter "presolving/restartminred" which forbids another restart if the last one was not successful enough
- new parameter "limits/absgap" to define an absolute gap limit

features:
- primal heuristics that run before the node is solved now know already whether the LP will be solved at the current
  node or not
- command shell now understands escape characters ",', and \ which makes it possible to read in files with spaces in the
  name
- updated XPress interface to XPress-MP 17 (contributed by Michael Perregard)
- the EXITSOL callback of the plugins is now called before the LP and the global cut pool are freed
- possibility of SAT-like restarts after a number of conflict constraints have been found
- in the root node of the very first run, heuristics with timing AFTERNODELPNODE, AFTERLPPLUNGE, AFTERPSEUDONODE, and
  AFTERPSEUDOPLUNGE are now called before the enforcement of the constraint handlers, in particular before the branching
  rules; in this way, the branching rule can already benefit from a tighter primal bound
- if a heuristic found a better solution after the LP loop (and in particular the AFTERNODE heuristics in the root node
  of the very first run, see above), domain propagation and LP solving is triggered again; this allows for additional
  reduced cost tightening and other dual propagations
- hard-coded relative objective gain to consider a separation loop to be stalling is now changed from 1e-3 to 1e-4,
  which means that separation is not aborted as early as before

fixed bugs:
- fixed bug with adding constraints with INITIAL=true and separating them afterwards, which lead to a second addition of
  the constraint's relaxation in the child node
- fixed bug in cmir cut separator, that 8*delta was not tried
- fixed bug in cmir cut separator with wrong sign of slack in row score function
- fixed bug with string pointer copy instead of string content duplication in constructors of C++ wrapper classes
- fixed bug in CPLEX interface with basis access methods that dualopt has to be called for more error status codes
- fixed bug with inserting two variable bounds of the same type on the same variable with the same bounding variable but
  with different sign of coefficient (e.g., x <= 10*z + 5 and x <= -5*z + 10); in previous version, one of the two was
  removed, although both have a useful meaning; now, we keep both, and detect a stronger global bound in the implication
  graph presolving
- fixed bug in cmir cut separator with weights fixed to zero, thus making the current aggregation invalid
- fixed bug that SCIPvarGetAvgSol() always returned the upper bound (affected guided diving heuristic)
- fixed bug in RENS, RINS, Local Branching, Crossover, and Mutation heuristics with wrong variable - subvariable
  assignments
- fixed bug in cmir cut separator with wrong calculation of cut efficacies
- objective function is now also checked for integrality after problem transformation (fixed a bug that a solution which
  was generated between transformation and presolving for an integral objective function did not reduce the cutoff bound
  by one)
- fixed a bug with cmir cut efficacy calculation (however, on my first tests, the performance reduced slightly!)
- fixed bug in infeasible/bound-exceeding LP conflict analysis if the bounds were relaxed in diving (happens in
  intshifting heuristic)
- too large deltas are now also rejected in c-MIR cut separation
- separation LPs are now immediately resolved after a bound change was generated by a cut separator; before, the
  separation round was prematurely aborted, which means that a separation round limit was sometimes reached very quickly
  and some of the separators were not even called a single time

- new method SCIPtransformProb() to create the transformed problem; enables the user, e.g., to add primal solutions

- LP and MPS file readers are now able to parse lazy constraints and user cuts sections

- in bfs node selector, parameter "minplungedepth" is now stronger than "maxplungedepth" if they conflict

  transformed problem (i.e., variables that were generated by a pricer) is not pulled back into the original space
  correctly, since the priced variables have no original counterpart

features:
- reactivated multiaggregation in cons_linear.c on binary variables again (possible due to bug fix below)
- introduced subversion string
- adding variable bounds automatically adds the corresponding implication
- conflict clauses are now collected in a conflict store, redundant clauses are eliminated, and only the best
  "conflict/maxclauses" clauses are added permanently to the problem; the remaining clauses are only added temporarily,
  if they can be used for repropagation
- improved debugging for infeasible cuts and propagations, given a primal feasible solution
- slightly changed LP resolving loop in conflict analysis
- diving heuristics now apply propagation at each step
- if CPLEX returns that the LP exceeds the bound and if no additional LP solves are allowed in conflict analysis, we
  have to perform one additional simplex iteration to get the dual solution that actually violates the objective limit

  USRFLAGS=-DNO_SIGACTION", "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_RAND_R", or "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_STRTOK_R"
- linear constraint handler now catches events of variables after the problem was completely transformed in order to
  avoid the whole bunch of LOCKSCHANGED events that are generated at problem transformation stage
- added redundancy detection for pairs of constraints in setppc constraint handler

fixed bugs:
- LP primal feasibility for bounds is now defined as absolute measure (was relative to the bound before); this fixes a
  bug (see alu8_9.mps), that an LP with an integral variable fixed to a large value yields an accepted solution with
  that variable slightly different than the fixed value; the integrality feasibility condition is measured with absolute
  differences, which leads to the fixed integer variable being fractional; this leads to an error if branching is
  performed on this variable
- locally fixed variables are no longer used as branching candidates even if their LP solution value is fractional (due
  to numerical reasons, see above)
- fixed minor bugs in debug code of primal.c and sol.c
- variables that are being multiaggregated are now automatically removed from all other variables' variable bound and
  implication arrays; this fixes bugs with methods, that rely on the fact, that the entries in the variable bound and
  implication arrays are active variables only
- aggregations are now always performed in a way, such that the variable of more general type is aggregated (with type
  generality being cont > implint > int > bin); in this way, a binary variable's representant is always binary (which
  was not the case before, and resulted in a bug in SCIPgetBinvarRepresentative())
- removed wrong asserts from lpi_cpx.c
- global bound changes now lead to the removal of redundant implications (such that the asserts in sepa_implbounds.c are
  now correct)
- due to usage of variable bounds, SCIPcalcMIR() may return LOOSE variables in the cut -> modified sepa_cmir.c,
  sepa_gomory.c, and sepa_strongcg.c to use SCIPcreateEmptyRow() and SCIPaddVarsToRow() instead of SCIPcreateRow() which
  only works for COLs
- removed bug in presol_probing.c: the vars of the sorted variables array have to be captured
- fixed bug in the output of solutions with priced variables
- fixed bug in propagation with parameters prop_maxrounds and prop_maxroundsroot
- removed wrong assertion in varAddImplic()
- conflict analysis can now handle errors in LP solving calls
- fixed bug in linear constraint handler with variables fixed to infinity
- fixed bug with potential infinite loop if a separator is delayed and the LP is infeasible
- fixed numerical bug in pseudo objective propagator with only slightly tightened bounds
- fixed bug with constraint handlers that can only enforce their constraints by adding cuts, but the maximal number of
  cuts to separate is set to 0; now, cuts that are generated in the constraint enforcement are used in any case
- removed bug in SCIPvarAddVlb() and SCIPvarAddVub() with fractional vlb/vubcoefs
- removed bug that an LP might be declared to be solved even if it was marked erroneous due to numerical problems
- fixed bug with redundant self implications that wrongly lead to the detection of infeasibility
- fixed bug that primal or dual rays might not be available because the wrong solver was used
- included message.o in LPI library, s.t. one can link this library indepentent of SCIP
- fixed bug that if diving heuristic that changes the objective values finds a solution, the cutoff is reinstalled in
  the LP solver (although the objective value has no meaning due to the objective function modification)
- fixed bug in knapsack constraint presolving with tightening coefficients and capacity
- fixed bug with modifiable constraints in linear constraint handler preprocessing
- fixed bug in clique separator that reduced performance
- increased performance of clique separator by allowing only a certain number of zero-weighted fill ins
- fixed bug in linear constraint handler that global activities are not updated after global bound changes

of SCIP, e.g. "tree.h" or "var.h".
- method SCIPreadProb() does not free the current problem - this is done in SCIPcreateProb() now, which is usually

  not influence the negation status anymore
- method SCIPvarGetProbvarBound() returns the multi-aggregated variable instead of aborting with an error message

  aborting with an error message
- new method SCIPvarGetOrigvarSum()
- method SCIPdispDecimal() is replaced by SCIPdispInt() and SCIPdispLongint()

SCIP version 0.78
=================

interface:
- new method SCIPvarIsInLP()
- new methods SCIPgetLPColumnObjval() and SCIPgetLPLooseObjval()
- new method SCIPcalcIntegralScalar() with arbitrary array of Real values
- new plugin class for relaxators (external relaxations, that can be used in parallel with LP relaxations)
- if more than one result code applies to a plugin's execution, it should return the one that is higher in the call's
  documentation list
- new method SCIPaddCoefKnapsack() in knapsack constraint handler
- removed SCIPisFeasible(); use !SCIPisFeasNegative() instead
- methods SCIPisIntegral(), SCIPisFracIntegral(), SCIPfloor(), SCIPceil(), and SCIPfrac() don't use the feasibility
  tolerance anymore (default: 1e-06); instead, they are using epsilon (default: 1e-09); instead, for handling
  integrality of a variable "in feasibility tolerances", new methods SCIPisFeasIntegral(), SCIPisFeasFracIntegral(),
  SCIPfeasFloor(), SCIPfeasCeil(), and SCIPfeasFrac() should be used
- new method SCIPisScalingIntegral() to check, whether the scaling of a value would lead to an integral value, measured
  against epsilon which is also scaled by the same scalar
- new methods SCIPgetRealarrayMinIdx(), SCIPgetRealarrayMaxIdx(), SCIPgetIntarrayMinIdx(), SCIPgetIntarrayMaxIdx(),
  SCIPgetBoolarrayMinIdx(), SCIPgetBoolarrayMaxIdx(), SCIPgetPtrarrayMinIdx(), and SCIPgetPtrarrayMaxIdx()
- new methods SCIPbsortPtrInt(), and SCIPbsortPtrIntInt()
- in LPI, the semantics of SCIPlpiHasPrimalRay() and SCIPlpiHasDualRay() changed: methods return TRUE, if a ray exists
  and the solver can return it; new methods SCIPlpiExistsPrimalRay() and SCIPlpiExistsDualRay() check whether a ray
  exists without checking, if the solver knows and can return the ray
- new method SCIPvarWasFixedAtIndex()
- new method SCIPaddConflictBd()
- even in optimized mode, the simple functions that are implemented as defines in the include files exist in the
  library, s.t. one can include the include files without NDEBUG and use the optimized library
- new method SCIPprintMemoryDiagnostic()
- new methods SCIPfindObj...() and SCIPgetObj...() in C++ wrapper interface to get the corresponding plugin object
- new branching rule plugin methods INITSOL and EXITSOL

parameters:
- slightly changed the meaning of parameter presolving/abortfac: a value of 0 now means to abort presolving only after
  no more change has been found

features:
- changed SCIProwCalcIntegralScalar() to a slightly different algorithm
- improved knapsack relaxation in linear constraint handler separator to scale the constraint in order to get integral
  coefficients instead of just rounding down all coefficients
- improved presolving of linear constraint handler: aggregation of two constraints with equal coefficient vector into
  single constraint
- improved presolving of knapsack constraint handler: aggregation of equal or negated variables in same constraint
- priority of separators, propagators, and presolvers decide whether the plugin is called before the corresponding
  constraint handler methods or after: plugins with nonnegative priorities are called before, plugins with negative
  priorities are called after the constraint handlers

fixed bugs:
- removed bug in knapsack constraint handler that appears if a variable is fixed to zero in knapsack presolving, which
  triggers a variable of the same knapsack to be fixed to one due to aggregation
- fixed bugs in consdataSwitchWatchedVars() of "or" and "and" constraint handlers
- fixed bug in all-fullstrong branching with getting strong branching information for columns not in current LP
- assigning a value to a fixed variable in a solution with SCIPsetSolVal() does not return an error anymore, if the
  value is equal to the fixed value of the variable
- implemented missing case in solve.c with branching rules that add constraints
- solving loop is now immediately aborted, if a node on the active path is marked to be cut off
- removed bug in resolving an interrupted problem, after the last solved node was cut off
- removed bug with infinite solving loop if LP solving is turned off
- removed bug in knapsack presolver
- removed bug with aborted solving in root node (e.g. due to time limit) that is tagged to be restarted
- changed numerics for integrality check of coefficients (fixed bug with accumulated errors in rows s.t. the row's
  activity is no longer integral although the row is marked being integer)
- fixed bugs in constraint handlers (and, logicor, or, setppc, xor) with calling conflict analysis during presolving
- slightly changed numerics in linear constraint handler presolving to fix a bug with coefficients detected to be scaled
  to an integral value, that are not integral after scaling due to a large scalar that increased the integrality gap to
  a value larger than epsilon
- fixed wrong assertion in xor constraint handler with switching both watched variables to unwatched
- removed bug in SCIPisScalingIntegral()
- removed bugs with calling SCIPtightenVarLb(), SCIPtightenVarUb(), SCIPinferVarLbCons(), SCIPinferVarUbCons(),
  SCIPinferVarLbProp(), and SCIPinferVarUbProp() in PROBLEM stage
- fixed bug in presolving with wrong number of newly fixed/aggregated/... variables/bounds/... after a restart


SCIP version 0.77
=================

installation:
- the file names in the archive file are now preceeded with a directory "scip-<version>/"
- the compiler is now also represented in the LP solver library names (e.g. you have to rename the softlink
  "libcplex.linux.x86.a" to "libcplex.linux.x86.gnu.a")

interface:
- added methods SCIPgetVarsLogicor() and SCIPgetNVarsLogicor() in logic or constraint handler
- methode SCIPgetGap() and SCIPgetTransGap() now return infinity, if primal and dual bound have opposite sign (this
  removes the oddness with the gap increasing while the dual bound approaches zero)

parameters:
- lp/colagelimit and lp/rowagelimit may now be set to -1 to disable deletion of columns/rows due to aging

features:
- infeasible LPs in diving now produce conflict clauses (if LP conflict analysis is enabled)
- conflict analysis was slightly modified
- slightly changed aging strategy of logic or constraint handler

fixed bugs:
- removed bug in conflict analysis that appears if the conflict is only active at the current depth level
- missing SCIPlpiIsPrimalFeasible() and SCIPlpiIsDualFeasible() implemented in lpi_spx.cpp and lpi_spx121.cpp
- removed preprocessing of linear constraint pairs with modifiable constraints
- removed wrong assert "assert(eventfilter->len == 0 || eventfilter->eventmask != 0x00000000)" from event.c
- removed wrong assert in conflict analysis (appeared on analyzing diving LP conflicts with both bounds of a non-binary
  variable changed)


SCIP version 0.76
=================

interface:
- new method SCIPchgVarBranchDirection()
- new method SCIPvarGetBranchDirection()
- new possible result code SCIP_DELAYED for primal heuristics
- changed SCIPcatchVarEvent() and SCIPdropVarEvent()
- method SCIPstage() is now called SCIPgetStage()
- method SCIPprintStatus() is now called SCIPprintStage()
- new method SCIPgetStatus() returns the solution status
- new method SCIPprintStatus() outputs the solution status (beware, that the old SCIPprintStatus() method is now called
  SCIPprintStage())

plugins:
- new method SCIPgetActivityLinear() in linear constraint handler
- new method SCIPgetFeasibilityLinear() in linear constraint handler

parameters:
- new parameter separating/efficacynorm to choose between Euclidean, maximum, sum, and discrete norm in efficacy
  calculation
- changed default frequency offset of pscostdiving (heuristics/pscostdiving/freqofs) to 2, and frequency offset of
  fracdiving (heuristics/feaspump/freqofs) to 0 in order to not call pscostdiving in root node, where nearly all pseudo
  costs are uninitialized

features:
- creation of reconvergence clauses in conflict analysis
- first node of each plunging is not treated as plunging node w.r.t. calling primal heuristics
- improved performance of logic or constraint handler due to better watched variables handling

fixed bugs:
- removed bugs in CLP Solver interface
- SCIP returned "gap limit reached" even if the problem was solved to optimality, if the optimal solution was found at a
  node with lower bound equal to the global lower bound
- after conversion of the focus node into a junction (e.g. in case of numerical troubles while solving the node's LP),
  the child nodes got the wrong LP fork attached (the common LP fork of the old and new focus node instead of the old
  focus node's LP fork)
- bug reconvergence clauses in conflict analysis if bounds on non-binary variables were the reason for the fixing of the
  uip to create a reconvergence clause for
- wrong sub calls in SCIPvarGet...CurrentRun() for aggregated variables
- variables' conflict set counter was not reset when the problem was resolved again

known bugs (still not fixed):
- unbounded models lead to an error
- air04 and air05 return wrong optimal value (1 too large): possibly due to strong branching or setppc propagation?
