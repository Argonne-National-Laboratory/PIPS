# Bash-shell version of schulz script from GAMS performance tools (http://www.gamsworld.org/performance/schulz.htm)
#
# Supervises processes and sends given signals via kill when elapsed time exceeds given thresholds
#
# Usage: ./schulz.sh <process> <timelimits> <signals> <sleep>
#  <process>     is a regular expression which determines the commands that should be supervised (default: ^gms)
#  <timelimits>  is a colon separated list of timelimits (default: 120:180:240)
#  <signals>     is a colon separated list of signals (default: 2:1:9)
#  <sleep>       is the number of seconds to wait before checking the process list again (default: 60)
#
#  Whenever a process which command matches the first argument exceeds one of the given timelimits,
#  the corresponding signal is send to that process.
#
#  That is, for the default values, for each process which command that starts with ^gms the following happens:
#  If it is running for more than 240 seconds, signal 9 (SIGKILL) is send.
#  If it is running for more than 280 seconds, but less-or-equal 240 seconds, signal 1 (SIGHUP) is send.
#  If it is running for more than 120 seconds, but less-or-equal 180 seconds, signal 2 (SIGINT) is send.
#  If it is running for less-or-equal 120 seconds, nothing happens.
#
#  The list of timelimits and signals need to have the same length.
