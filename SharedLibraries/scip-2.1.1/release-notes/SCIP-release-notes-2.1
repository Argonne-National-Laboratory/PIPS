Notes for SCIP Release 2.1


Features
========

- Major extensions for nonlinear CIP
  + New constraint handlers for nonlinear equations with algebraic expressions (only Beta),
    absolute power constraints, and bivariate nonlinear constraints (only Beta)
  + New expression graph data structure for domain propagation and reformulation
  + Simple convexity check and simplification for expression trees and graphs
  + New option for n-ary branching on nonlinear variables (within pseudocost branching rule)
  + New interval arithmetic functions for bivariate quadratic expressions

- New funtionalities in the interactive shell (modify current CIP instance, write NLP relaxation)

- In branch-and-price algorithms, created variables can now be deleted (beta version)

- New constraint handlers for pseudoboolean and disjunction constraints (both beta)

- New original solution storage capability, which allows transfering solutions between SCIP runs

- New separator for close cuts and a new function to compute relative interior points of the LP

- Propagators are now also called in node presolving

- Extended support of lazy bounds

- New targets "(un)install" in Makefile, support for valgrind in testing environment

- New scripts for running tests with GAMS


Interfaces
==========

- Improved SOPLEX interface (LP simplifier)

- Improved CPLEX interface, including measures for numerical stability

- New reader for (standard) bounds on variables 

- Improved support for wbo format for weighted PBO problems, IBM's xml-solution
  format, and pip and zimpl format for polynomial mixed-integer programs

- Extended reader for Flatzinc models to handle cumulative constraints

- Extended reader for CIP models to handle various new constraints, including all types of linear constraints

- Extended writer for GAMS and pip format to write more types of nonlinear constraints


Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- Improved LNS and undercover heuristics

- Improved knapsack cover cuts 

- Reorganized filtering process of separation storage (allows adding cuts for different solutions)

- Improved presolving for various constraint handlers

- Improved propagation methods for variable bound constraints

- Improved performance for quadratic constraints

- More robust sorting functions 

- Many bug fixes


Additional Notes
================

- The display of statistics for presolvers, propagators, constraints and LP
  solving has changed. For details see the CHANGELOG file.

- The interface contains several additional callback functions and
  parameters for plugins. Some effort may be required to compile your old
  projects with SCIP 2.1. For details see section "Changes between version
  2.0 and 2.1" in the doxygen documentation. See also the CHANGELOG file
  for additional information.

- Linking against Clp and Ipopt has been simplified. Only the directory where the
  package has been installed need to be provided now. For details see the INSTALL file.

- The check scripts expect *.test and *.solu files now in the directory check/testset.
