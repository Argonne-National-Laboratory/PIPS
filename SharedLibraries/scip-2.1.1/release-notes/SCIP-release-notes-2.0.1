Notes for SCIP Release 2.0.1


Interfaces
==========

- allow access of transformed constraints in SCIP_STAGE_TRANSFORMED

- replaced parameter <constraints/quadratic/minefficacy> by
  <constraints/quadratic/minefficacysepa> and
  <constraints/quadratic/minefficacyenfo>

- added possible values 'a' and 'e' for <constraints/soc/nlpform> to enable
  automatic choice and convex exponential-sqrt form for SOC constraint
  representation in NLP

Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- SCIP with SoPlex as LP solver now uses auto pricing by default (start
  with devex, switch to steepest edge after some iterations); this fixes
  timeouts on instances where devex converges very slowly

- fixing lifting of new knapsack items which are negated items of already
  included items, this could lead to very long presolving

- fixed performance issue in presolving w.r.t. to computing the number of
  new fixings, aggregated, and so on before a constraint handler presolver
  is called

- in case of adding constraints during pricing with initial flag set to
  TRUE, we add now these constraints after the pricing round to the LP

- changed parameter values in clique separator in order to avoid very large
  branch-and-bound trees
