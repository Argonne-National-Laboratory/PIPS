Notes for SCIP Release 2.0.2

Performance Improvements
========================

- knapsack constraints are now propagated and separated faster;
  SCIPsolveKnapsackExactly() now works faster and requires less memory

- reduced memory usage of shift-and-propagate heuristic

- improved twoopt-heuristic by considering larger search domains

- the SoPlex interface now has the capability to provide a primal ray,
  provided it is compiled against the next SoPlex release (>= 1.5.0.2)


See the CHANGELOG file for a list of bugfixes.
