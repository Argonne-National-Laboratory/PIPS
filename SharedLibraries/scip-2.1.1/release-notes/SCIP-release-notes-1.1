Notes for SCIP Release 1.1


General
=======

- Extended the capabilities of SCIP to output problems in different
  formats (LP, MPS, CIP, ...). You can output the original and
  transformed problem. Furthermore, generic names can be given to the
  variables and constraints.

- New constraint handlers for SOS type 1 and 2 constraints.

- There is a new file make/make.projects supporting the compilation of
  projects using SCIP.

- SCIP can now count integer feasible solutions for IPs/CIPs (without
  continuous variables).

- The feasibility test for solutions at the end of the execution now
  outputs more useful information. This made some changes in the
  interface of constraint handlers necessary.

- Added an example for the graph coloring problem, showing the usage
  of column generation.

- Pseudo-Boolean problems can be read and handled by SCIP.

- New heuristic DINS.

- New cutting plane separator MCF (beta version).


Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- Improved sorting functions. They now use quick-sort/shell-sort
  depending on the size.

- The preprocessing has been revised. It now applies bound
  computations in a numerically more stable way. The pairwise
  comparison of linear, logicor, and setppc constraints has been
  improved.

- The timing calls have been reworked.

- The LP-interfaces to Clp and SoPlex have been revised and adapted
  to the changes in these solvers.

- Many internal performance improvements.

- Many internal bug fixes.


For details see the CHANGELOG file. Some of the interface functions
were changed. See "Changes between version 1.0 and 1.1" in the doxygen
documentation for more information.
