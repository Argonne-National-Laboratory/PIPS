Notes for SCIP Release 1.2


Features
========

- Preliminary support of non-convex MIQCPs: Constraint handler for
  quadratic constraints, NLP heuristic, and Ipopt interface

- Improved support of branch-and-price: SCIP now supports lazy bounds, early 
  branching/incomplete pricing, and primal heuristics during pricing loop

- Constraint handler for indicator constraints and parsing them from *.lp
  and *.zpl files

- Heuristics which are applied before root LP

- Black-box lexicographic dual simplex algorithm

- Copy constructors and i/o functionality for constraints


Interfaces
==========

- First version of LP interfaces to Gurobi and QSopt

- Major performance improvements in LP interfaces to Clp, Mosek, and SoPlex

- Reader for Flatzinc and GAMS models

- Adjusted interface to Zimpl version 3.0.0

- On http://code.google.com/p/python-zibopt/source/checkout you find a beta 
  version of a python interface to SCIP implemented by Ryan J. O'Neil.
  

Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- Enhanced MCF cuts: stable version, used by default

- Improved hybrid branching

- Increased numerical stability for Big M formulations

- Several improvements in presolving

- Many bug fixes


For details see the CHANGELOG file. Some of the interface functions
were changed. See "Changes between version 1.1 and 1.2" in the doxygen
documentation for additional information.
