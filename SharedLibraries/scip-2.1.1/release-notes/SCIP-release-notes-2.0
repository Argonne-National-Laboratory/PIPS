Notes for SCIP Release 2.0


Features
========

- SCIP can now copy instances (e.g. for heuristics)

- New rounding and propagation heuristics, rapid learning

- Added the feasibility pump to 2.0

- New constraint handlers for linking constraints (only Beta), cumulative constraints,
  and for breaking orbitopal symmetries

- New separators for oddcycle cuts and Chvatal-Gomory cuts using sub-MIPs

- New propagator for variable bounds

- Solution counting extended to constraint integer programs, this also
  includes constraint integer programs which contain continuous variables

- External branching candidates (of interest if a relaxator or constraint
  handler wants to provide branching candidates)

- New branch-and-price example which includes Ryan/Foster branching (binpacking example)

- New example illustrating the use of an event handler (example/Eventhdlr)

- More support for nonlinear CIPs:
  + Improved constraint handler for quadratic constraints
  + New constraint handler for second order cone constraints
  + New MINLP heuristics (undercover, subnlp)
  + Preliminary support for non-linear relaxations (via expression trees)
  + Automatic branching on solutions from arbitrary relaxations and on continuous variables


Interfaces
==========

- Improved SoPlex interface

- Improved Xpress interface

- Improved CPLEX interface

- NLP solver interface (NLPI) now independent of SCIP like LPI

- Enhanced user interface for callable library: manual restarts,
  predefined settings, and many other features

- Support of wbo format for weighted PBO problems, IBM's xml-solution
  format, and pip format for polynomial mixed-integer programs

- Extended reader for Flatzinc models

- Extended reader for .lp and .mps files for semicontinuous variables
  and quadratic objective or constraints


Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- Several improvements in presolving

- Enhanced handling of indicator constraints

- Improved zerohalf cuts

- Many bug fixes


Additional Notes
================

- A bug in the Makefiles of older versions of the SCIP examples may cause
  data loss. If you have a custom Makefile, please ensure that the target
  "clean" is changed as described here:
  http://scip.zib.de/download/bugfixes/scip-1.2.0/make.txt.

- The additional NLPI library requires a change in the Makefile of SCIP's project:
  The $(MAINFILE) target now has $(NLPILIBFILE) as additional dependency and the linking
  command requires $(LINKCXX_l)$(NLPILIB)$(LINKLIBSUFFIX) as additional argument.

- The interface contains several additional callback functions and
  parameters for plugins. Some effort may be required to compile your
  own projects with SCIP 2.0. For details see the CHANGELOG file. See
  also "Changes between version 1.2 and 2.0" in the doxygen
  documentation for additional information.
