  Fix trouble with m = 0 (no constraints) on systems with a buggy
malloc (such that malloc(0) = 0).

Sat Jun 28 10:47:30 EDT 1997
  Updates from rvdb, plus tweaks to aloqo.c to fix bugs in handling
the "objno" keyword.

Thu Oct 23 11:37:34 EDT 1997
  Update to loqo version 3.10.

Sat Oct 25 06:19:22 EDT 1997
  Replace keyword honor_initsol with two keywords, ignore_initsol and
zero_initsol.  If ignore_initsol is specified, then LOQO makes its
automatic choice of initial guess; otherwise, if zero_initsol is given,
LOQO starts at the origin; otherwise, if an explicit initial guess
appears, it is used; otherwise LOQO makes its automatic choice.  This
gives the same default behavior as before, but permits more control.

Wed Oct 29 17:46:43 EST 1997
  Tweak from Bob Vanderbei, so keyword honor_bounds must be assigned
0 or 1.

Fri Apr  3 13:40:14 EST 1998
  aloqo.c: updated to return solve_result_num to AMPL.
  makefile: omit $S/funcadd0.o; on most systems, $S/amplsolver.a now
provides a recommended default funcadd: see ampl/solvers/funclink/README
for details.

Tue Jul 28 22:28:02 EDT 1998
  README.loqo: add table of possible solve_result_num values.

Wed Oct 14 15:39:03 EDT 1998
  aloqo.c version.c: update to LOQO 3.18.

Fri Feb 18 10:32:44 EST 2000
  aloqo.c updated for LOQO 4.05c; version.c omitted (it's now in the
source supplied by Vanderbei); makefile renamed makefile.u; makefile.vc
added.

Fri Apr 28 18:46:07 EDT 2000
  aloqo.c:  add an evaluation count (for the objective, its gradient,
nonlinear constraints and their Jacobian matrix) to the solution
message and add times for nonlinear evaluations to the output produced
by "timing=1" or "timing=2".  There is one Hessian evaluation per
iteration, so in effect the number of Hessian evaluations was already
being reported.

Fri Jun  2 09:38:34 EDT 2000
  aloqo.c: tweak for LOQO 5.03.  Show version (short form) in solve
message.  New keyword version: version=1 in $loqo_options causes more
detailed version information (the same as with command-line option -v)
to be included in the solve message.

Wed Nov 15 15:31:16 EST 2000
  aloqo.c:  clean up qtest(); supply variable and constraint names
when verbose >= 3.

Sat Jun  2 17:33:42 EDT 2001
  aloqo.c:  insert hesset() calls.

Tue Jun  5 10:35:40 EDT 2001
  aloqo.c: minor cleanups:  replace congrd calls with a 2-line "for"
(copying values just computed by jacval), and omit unused variables.

Tue May  7 16:32:32 EDT 2002
  aloqo.c: adjust handling of "version" for consistency with other
solvers.  Driver date added to output for "version" and -v.

20111014
  aloqo.c: update to LOQO version 6.08.
  README.1st, makefile.u, makefile.vc: update contact details.
