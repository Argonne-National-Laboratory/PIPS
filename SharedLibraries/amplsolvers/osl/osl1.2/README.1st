The source files in this directory create osl, a solver based on
version 1.2 of IBM's OSL (Optimization Subroutine Library) that
handles linear, mixed-integer, and network optimization problems.

OSL 1.2 is no longer distributed.  This directory is just for
the benefit of people who still have OSL 1.2.

If your float.h doesn't #define DBL_MAX to be a constant,
compile osl.c with Bad_DBL_MAX #defined, e.g. by adding
-DBad_DBL_MAX to the CFLAGS assignment in the makefile.
