  donlp.c, setup1.f: fix bug in handling linear constraints.

Fri Oct 17 01:13:39 EDT 1997
  donlp.c, setup1.f: fix more confusion between setup and setup0
(that caused trouble with infeasible simple-bound constraints).
Fix sign of objective reported in solution message for maximization
problems.

Tue Oct 21 10:43:27 EDT 1997
  Fix bug (typo) that sometimes caused a fault or other failure
(e.g., on ampl/models/nlmodels/hs109.mod on some systems).
  New keyword maxit limits the number of iterations.
  Arrange for "intakt=1" to give detailed output on stdout without
"silent=0" having to be specified, and (without "silent=0") arrange
for no surprise files to be written.

Fri Oct 24 00:34:49 EDT 1997
  Update donlp.c and setup1.f to work with a new version of donlp2
whose source has just been installed in /netlib/opt/donlp2.

Sat Feb  7 00:25:17 EST 1998
  Update donlp.c and setup1.f to add keyword epsx to $donlp2_options
(convergence tolerance).

Mon Feb  9 17:11:40 EST 1998
  Adjust donlp.c, setup1.f to update the counters that DONLP2 prints
when you ask for lots of output.  The "component constraint" count
in the solver summary message now includes evaluations of simple-
bound constraints.

Thu Apr  2 16:50:21 EST 1998
  donlp.c: updated to return solve_result_num to AMPL.
  makefile: omit $S/funcadd0.o; on most systems, $S/amplsolver.a now
provides a recommended default funcadd: see ampl/solvers/funclink/README
for details.

Sun Jun  7 01:33:46 EDT 1998
  donlp2: update for use with DONLP2 version 19980529, which is now
available from netlib's opt directory.  New source file donlpver.c0,
which the makefile turns into donlpver.c by inserting the operating
system name and version.  Now donlp2 recognizes suffix .vsclog10 on
variables as the base-10 logarithm of a scale factor, so
(internal variable) * 10^(variable.vsclog10) = (modeler's) variable.

Tue Jul 28 22:22:32 EDT 1998
  donlpver.c0: adjust to reflect updated /netlib/opt/donlp2/donlp2.f
(updated 24 June 1998).

Fri Oct 16 01:05:54 EDT 1998
  setup1.f: omit unused final argument to setup1; it caused the
implicit length argument for "name0" to be lost and thus sometimes
caused odd extra characters to be assigned to "name".

Tue May 18 18:52:31 EDT 1999
  For consistency with other solvers, add "objno" keyword (as a synonym
for nprob).  If there are too many constraints, report this in the
solve_message.

Sun Sep  5 23:31:19 EDT 1999
  donlp.c donlpver.c setup1.f: updated to reflect updated source in
/netlib/opt/donlp2.

Mon Sep 27 11:57:51 EDT 1999
  donlp.c: when there are integer variables, note in the solution
message that they are ignored.
  makefile: renamed makefile.u.

Thu Feb  3 22:20:46 EST 2000
  makefile.vc (for Microsoft Visual C++) added.

Tue May  7 16:06:10 EDT 2002
  makefile.*, donlp.c: omit donlpver.c0, which is now automatically
incorporated into donlp.c and the solver interface library.

Fri Oct  4 23:17:33 EDT 2002
  makefile.u, makefile.vc: minor tweaks (favor $FC; fix sdonlp2.exe rule).
