  Extensive revisions to the entire ampl/solvers tree, corresponding
to an updated "Hooking Your Solver to AMPL":
	ftp://netlib.bell-labs.com/ampl/REFS/hooking.ps.gz

Tue Apr 22 07:56:07 EDT 1997
  pfg_read.c pfghread.c: fix glitch that could cause a fault (during
setup for Hessian computations).

Thu Apr 24 12:46:31 EDT 1997
  misc.c: fix a glitch in reading suffix tables (a forthcoming AMPL
extension).

Sun May 18 13:40:12 EDT 1997
  Tweaks: use a replaceable "getenv"; augment r_opn.hd (for a
forthcoming driver); add rule for stderr.obj to makefile.*.

Thu May 29 23:20:52 EDT 1997
  Fix bug with xknown() with problems involving defined variables:
derivatives were sometimes miscomputed.

Wed Jun  4 11:44:14 EDT 1997
  Adjust struct psb_elem in psinfo.h (currently just for use
in lancelot/lancelot.c).  Recompile amplsolver.a (or amplsolv.lib) from
scratch, even if you get just the updated files (asldate.c, pfg_read.c,
psinfo.h, xsum0.out).
  Add file README.f77 with changes that permit using the native Fortran
77 compiler on some systems.

Tue Jun 17 22:29:37 EDT 1997
  Fix a fault that was possible in the .nl readers when the .nl file
was written with presolve turned off.

Thu Jun 26 23:52:36 EDT 1997
  Adjust Malloc and M1alloc so Malloc(0) and M1alloc(0) return nonzero
values even if malloc is buggy in that malloc(0) returns 0.

Wed Jul  9 14:55:48 EDT 1997
  Adjust Realloc so Realloc(0,n) works analogously to Malloc(0).
  New field n_eqn gives (in struct Edaginfo) gives the number of
equality constraints (if known from versions of ampl >= 19970627),
or -1. This change requires recompiling all of amplsolver.a and any
solver objects that #include "asl.h".
  Tweak to reading numbers of complementarity constraints in .nl headers
(to be further documented later).
  getstub.c: fix glitch that sometimes caused -? to say
"...[options] [options]..." rather than "...[options]...".
  obj_prec.c: adjust to use getenv_ASL.

Mon Jul 21 12:33:08 EDT 1997
  funcaddk.c: add missing line (AmplExports *ae = al->AE;) to function
mean.

Tue Jul 22 16:53:59 EDT 1997
  func_add.c: ignore argtype = 6.

Thu Aug 14 00:34:10 EDT 1997
  Adjust getstub.c and getstub.h to permit specifying that underscores
should be retained (rather than turned into blanks) in names passed to
a Solver_KW_func.  An enum now names bits in the "flags" field, with
ASL_OI_want_funcadd (== 1) meaning that funcadd should be called, and
ASL_OI_keep_underscores (== 2) meaning that underscores should be kept.

Tue Aug 19 15:39:22 EDT 1997
  pfg_read.c (and pfghread.c): fix bugs with linear defined variables
referenced by other linear defined variables.  Example:
	set I := 1..4;
	var x{I} >= 0 := .25;
	convex: sum{i in I} x[i] = 1;
	var y = x[1];
	var d = 1 + y;
	s.t. zot{j in 1..2}: x[j] + d >= .1;
	minimize foo: sin(x[1]);
led to an infinite loop.  A more complicated example led to an assertion
failure.  (Henceforth, compile pfghread.c and pfg_read.c with -DDEBUG
if you want the assertions checked.)

Wed Aug 20 16:11:24 EDT 1997
  Once again, pfg_read.c (and pfghread.c): fix another bug with linear
defined variables that involve other linear defined variables, this time
when constant terms are involved.  The constant terms sometimes got
lost.  Example:
	set I := 1..3;
	var x{i in I} >= 0 := i;
	var y = x[1];
	var z = y + 1;
	s.t. bletch: sum{i in I} x[i] + y + z == 2;
	s.t. zap: sum{i in 1..2} x[i] + z == 2;

Fri Sep 12 01:09:37 EDT 1997
 funcadd.c: for hypot(0,0), set the Hessian to all zeros.
 mip_pri.c: change "AMPl" to "AMPL".
 pfg_read.c (and pfghread.c):
   1. Fix glitch affecting Hessian computations when imported
(user-defined) functions involve some constant arguments.
   2. Fix more bugs in handling defined variables.  Example:
	var x0 >= 0 := 1;
	var x1 >= 0 := 3;
	var v2 = x1 - 2;
	var v3 = v2 * x0 + 10.4;	# the constant term 10.4
	s.t. c: v3 = 0;			# caused trouble
   3. Fix bug in allocation of al->hes for imported functions:
constant arguments were not counted.
 sphes.c: fix glitch in computing sparsity of Hessians when imported
functions are involved.

Fri Sep 12 18:51:41 EDT 1997
  pfg_read.c (and pfghread.c): fix two glitches that caused faults with
certain models.

Fri Oct 10 17:13:14 EDT 1997
  stdio1.h0: protect #define Char with #ifndef Char .
  asl.h, jac0dim.c: change neqn to n_eqn (new field giving the number
of equations), to reduce the chance of name classes (such as occurred
in fsqp/fsqp.c).  The comments above for 19970709 have been adjusted.

Sat Oct 11 16:32:51 EDT 1997
  Add to README another pointer to makefile comments; update xsum0.out
(missed yesterday).

Thu Oct 16 13:47:06 EDT 1997
  con1ival.c, con2ival.c: fix bug with congrd(n, i, x, g, nerror)
(Fortran 77 notation): if called with nerror < 0 at an (i,x) pair
at which conival was not called, no gradient was computed.

Thu Oct 23 20:09:51 EDT 1997
  pfg_read.c pfghread.c: fix bug that could cause a fault on some
machines (e.g., HP).

Mon Nov  3 23:45:32 EST 1997
  f_read.c fg_read.c fgh_read.c pfg_read.c pfghread.c:  fix bug in
reading cvar array for complementarity constraints (to be further
documented later).

Fri Nov  7 03:41:23 EST 1997
  Add variants of xknown() with apparent signatures
	void xknowne(real *X, fint *nerror);
	void xknowe_(real *X, fint *nerror);
that treat errors in evaluating common expressions the same way as
other routines (objval, conval, etc.) that have a final nerror argument.

Fri Nov  7 09:20:15 EST 1997
  mip_pri.c nqpcheck.c: for simplicitly, back off changes early this AM
that made some arrays available to either free() or M1record().  Arrays
returned by these routines are freed automatically by ASL_free(&asl).

Tue Nov 11 16:25:21 EST 1997
  misc.c: fix botch introduced 19971107: s/xknowe(/xknowne(/
  asl.h misc.c: change M1record to a Char** function, permitting one
to Realloc or free the recorded memory block if one updates or zeros
*(the return value from M1record) accordingly.

Tue Dec  2 23:50:40 EST 1997
  README.f77: point out need to remove -lf2c (references to libf2c.a)
when using native Fortran compilers.

Tue Jan 13 22:45:01 EST 1998
  nqpcheck.c: if called with NULL for any of rowqp, colqp, or delsqp,
omit changes that require adding quadratic-term contributions to
the return values of objval, conval, and conival (as is done by
function qterm in examples/qtest.c).

Wed Jan 14 08:49:00 EST 1998
  jac0dim.c: tweak (to treatment of Arith_Kind_ASL) foreshadowing
forthcoming changes.

Wed Feb  4 13:25:05 EST 1998
  jac0dim.c: adjust jacdim variants to assume stub is null-terminated
if stub_len <= 0.  (This slightly simplifies invocations of these
routines, as it removes the need for a strlen call, and though choosing
file names with blanks in them is a very bad idea, this change permits
blanks in the "stub".)

Wed Feb 11 15:10:54 EST 1998
  .nl file readers: fix a fault that was possible with certain
nonlinear .nl files generated with "option presolve 0".

Wed Mar 25 23:26:13 EST 1998
  con1ival.c, con2ival.c: fix bug in handling nerror when a gradient
is requested at a point different from the one where the constraint
was most recently evaluated.  The bug caused wrong gradients to be
returned (the input G was unchanged).
  misc.c: fix glitch in Realloc's checking for a null return.
  Many routines: minor updates; new facilities for receiving and
transmitting user-defined suffixes (to be described later).  On most
systems, nonlinear solvers should no longer link with funcadd0.o, but
rather should link automatically with funcadd1.o, which is now in
amplsolver.a.  Exceptions: under MSDOS and AIX earlier than AIX 4.2,
nonlinear solvers should still link with funcadd0.o (or otherwise,
as indicated in the funclink subdirectory).

Thu Mar 26 18:03:37 EST 1998
  New file funcaddr.c, for compiling funcadd1.c so as to release
amplfunc.dll when ASL_free() is called, rather than at the end of
execution.  This is for use with shared libraries that may be loaded
and unloaded repeatedly during a single program execution, such as
MATLAB mex files.  Use of funcaddr.c is now illustrated in the rules
for amplfunc.mex and spamfunc.mex in examples/makefile.

Fri Mar 27 14:40:16 EST 1998
  getstub.c: minor tweak for what now should be an unusual case:
statically linking a funcadd.o with the solver.

Mon Mar 30 16:43:25 EST 1998
  asl.h: make solve_result_num a synonym for asl->i.solve_code_, the
value that appears in AMPL sessions as solve_result_num.

Thu Apr  2 17:36:57 EST 1998
  func_add.c: if -ix is not given, assume -i$AMPLFUNC .

Mon Apr  6 16:09:37 EDT 1998
  qp_read.c: fix bug in qp_opify()'s handling of min(...) and max(...)
expressions.

Fri Apr 10 23:16:08 EDT 1998
  makefile: add funcaddr.c to xsum.out.

Fri May  8 11:33:00 EDT 1998
  funcadd1.c: permit compiling with (e.g.) -DFUNCADD="funcadd_ASL_"
to change the name sought in amplfunc.dll from "funcadd_ASL" to
"funcadd_ASL_".  Unless compiled with -DNO_DLOPEN_ERROR_MESSAGE,
print a warning (on Stderr) when -i or $AMPLFUNC is specified
and the library does not exist or cannot be loaded.  On systems
that provide a dlerror() function that returns a string explaining
what went wrong, print that string.  (Compile with -DNO_DLERROR if
dlerror() is buggy, as it is, e.g., in at least one older version
of Linux).
  makefile.wat: compile funcadd1.c with -DFUNCADD="funcadd_ASL_" .
If you use non-default calling conventions, you may have to adjust
this detail.

Tue May 12 19:00:35 EDT 1998
  dtoa.c: fix a glitch introduced with the scaling of 19970212
that caused one-bit rounding errors in certain denormal numbers, such
as 8.44291197326099e-309, which was read as 8.442911973260987e-309.
  funcadd1.c: tweak to prevent undesired complaint of missing
amplfunc.dll with -DWIN32.
  arithchk.c and makefiles: determine whether long long is available.

Fri May 15 16:46:18 EDT 1998
  dtoa.c: tweak to round 2.2250738585072012e-308 correctly.
  f_read.c fg_read.c: tweak so f_read does not pull in r_ops_ASL.

Tue May 26 13:16:50 EDT 1998
  objconst.c: correct glitch in use with pfg_read and pfgh_read.
Note that objconst(n) returns 0 if objective n is not affine.

Wed May 27 16:48:25 EDT 1998
  objconst.c: add a missing #undef f_OPNUM; asldate.c not changed.

Thu Jun 18 01:13:10 EDT 1998
  Fix possible fault in, e.g., sphes(), with certain uses of defined
variables.  The fix involves a data structure change, so it is best
to recompile all of amplsolver.a and any objects that include the
solver interface header files.
  Adjust xectim.c to use getrusage() on Unix systems (for CPU time
resolution of 1 microsecond).

Fri Jun 19 18:52:08 EDT 1998
  Fix typo in comments in funcadd.h (about where to store partials).
  arithchk.c: add logic for detecting IEEE-like arithmetic that
flushes underflows to 0 (a bad thing).

Wed Jun 24 16:33:55 EDT 1998
  funcadd.h: type of Errmsg changed from Char to char.
  rops.c, rops2.c: explicitly check for sqrt(negative number) rather
than relying on errno being set to indicate this.  There exists at
least one systems where this matters.

Fri Jun 26 08:55:38 EDT 1998
  funcadd1.c: minor tweak for compilation under SunOS 4.1x; asldate.c
not changed.

Tue Jul 14 14:43:13 EDT 1998
  pfg_read.c pfghread.c: discard linear terms that end up with a
coefficient of 0.  This is mostly invisible, but can avoid a division
by 0 (in pfg_read or pfgh_read) in certain complicated examples.

Thu Aug 27 07:51:38 EDT 1998
  conpval.c pfg_read.c pfghread.c: fix bug in handling two or more
constraints (or objectives) involving a sum of monadic functions of
the same linear combinations of variables.  This only affected
problems read with pfg_read() and pfgh_read().  Example:
	var x;
	s.t. zap{i in 1..2}: sqrt((x - i)^2 + 1) >= 0;
(In this example, zap[2] was miscomputed.)  Also, fix faults in some
contexts in handling "constant" arguments of the form (e.g.) x-x for
some variable x.

Mon Aug 31 17:52:08 EDT 1998
  pfg_read.c pfghread.c: "invisible" tweak to eliminate complaints of
"cast to pointer from integer of different size" on some machines.

Thu Sep  3 09:27:57 EDT 1998
  Add comments about -DNANCHECK and -DNO_ERRNO to README.

Wed Oct 14 00:30:21 EDT 1998
  getstub.[ch]: new bit ASL_OI_never_echo for Option_Info.option_echo
suppresses echoing of options (should it be desirable to scan them
twice).
  New bits ASL_find_c_class, ASL_find_o_class, and their union
ASL_find_co_class in the flags argument to pfg_read() and pfgh_read()
instructs them to compute four new fields of ((ASL_pfg*)asl)->I
and ((ASL_pfgh*)asl)->I classifying objectives and constraints
as constant (0), linear (1), quadratic (2), or general nonlinear 3
(fields c_class and o_class) and giving the maximum values of these
arrays (max_c_class and max_o_class).
  New field nlvog of struct Edaginfo; objgrd(np,x,g,ne) sets g[i] = 0
if the objective does not depend on x[i] and i < nlvog (or
i < max(c_vars, o_vars) if nlvog is left at 0); nlvog must be set
before the .nl reader is called.  This matters to minos and snopt,
whose drivers have been updated to specify asl->i.nlvog = nlvo.

Fri Oct 30 01:50:47 EST 1998
  Fix botch in handling first derivatives of user-defined functions
having some numeric constant arguments and some arguments involving
variables: if the total number of numerical arguments was more than 8,
unpredictable behavior was possible.
  Fix bug in dtoa.c's handling of non-IEEE arithmetic machines,
such as SGI machines executing -n32 and -64 (but not -o32) binaries,
that flush underflows to zero instead of underflowing gradually.

Fri Nov  6 14:49:37 EST 1998
  dtoa.c: tweak to remove LL suffixes from numeric constants (for
compilers that offer a 64-bit long long type but do not recognize the
LL constants prescribed by C9x, the proposed update to the ANSI/ISO C
standard).  Thanks to Earl Chew for pointing out the existence of such
compilers.  This change should be invisible on most systems.

Thu Nov 19 10:41:10 EST 1998
  xectim.c: adjust so compilation with -DNO_RUSAGE will use CLK_TCK
if available (on Unix systems, in limits.h).

Tue Nov 24 23:32:33 EST 1998
  names.c: fix glitch in obj_name(): when no .row file was present,
obj_name(n) overwrote con_name(n).

Wed Dec  9 10:11:12 EST 1998
  README.SGI added describing how to restore IEEE arithmetic under
SGI's -n32 and -64 compilation modes.

Tue Dec 15 19:29:17 EST 1998
  conpval.c: with readers pfg_read and pfgh_read, objgrd(nprob,x,g,ne)
was treated as objgrd(0,x,g,ne).
  conpval.c, obj2val.c, objval.c: calls on objgrd(nprob,x,g,ne) for
several nprob values and the same x might have given wrong gradients
after the first call for that x.
  pshvprod.c: fix rarely seen bug in Hessian computations involving
defined variables; a couple of operators that should have been +=
were simply = in defined variables whose value was the product of
two or more variables, at most one of which was fixed by presolve.
Example:
	var w := 3;  var x = 1;
	var y = w*x; var z = w*y;
	minimize zot: z; # w^2
  sphes.c: fix possible fault when sphsetup() is called a second time.

Wed Jan 13 11:32:45 EST 1999
  README: add new final paragraph about make invocations.
  Update xsum0.out (missed copying this file on 19981215).

Tue Jan 19 01:08:35 EST 1999
  New source file suf_sos.c helps use SOS suffixes (to be documented).
Changes to asl.h (and several other source files) require all of
amplsolver.a (or amplsolv.lib) to be recompiled.

Tue Jan 19 11:28:11 EST 1999
  suf_sos.c: add missing #ifdef KR_header stuff; asldate.c not changed.

Mon Feb  1 17:50:46 EST 1999
  suf_sos.c: fix botch in adjusting incoming integer-valued suffixes.
  amplsolv.lbc, amplsolv.sy: add suf_sos.obj.

Sat Feb  6 17:55:09 EST 1999
  asl.h: SufDesc: union u changed to struct u to facilitate debugging;
amplsolver.a must be recompiled.
  suf_sos.c: enhanced to process suffixes .sosno and .ref (which can
be set explicitly with let commands) as well as the .sos and .sosref
suffixes supplied implicitly by AMPL (e.g., when it linearizes
piecewise-linear terms).  Each distinct nonzero .sosno value
designates an SOS set, of type 1 for positive .sosno values and
of type 2 for negative values.  The .ref suffix contains corresponding
reference values.  Solvers calling suf_sos() must now declare all of
the above mentioned suffixes.  See, e.g., suftab and the suf_sos()
invocation in solvers/cplex/cplex.c.

Fri Feb 12 16:53:49 EST 1999
  misc.c: zero SufDesc field u.i in suf_declare (required by changes of
19990206).
  writesol.c: under "g" (ASCII) format, cope with empty lines in the
solution message.  (Sensible solver drivers do not have such lines.)

Fri Mar 19 08:42:14 EST 1999
  asl.h: comments about ASL_reader_flag_bits added.
  suf_sos.c: trivial change; asldate.c not updated.

Fri Apr  9 00:44:19 EDT 1999
  pfg_read.c pfghread.c: fix a bug (fault or worse) that bit under
complicated conditions.
  readsol.c: fix a bug in handling some incomplete .sol files.
  funcadd.h: new entry Qsortv in AmplExports, plus declarations for
handling AMPL tables (a forthcoming extension).
  func_add.c: add dummy Add_table_handler and Crypto routines (for
funcadd() routines that do not check that ae->asl is nonzero before
calling these routines, which are meaningful only to AMPL).
  New routine fpinit(), called by jac0dim, to initialize the floating-
point arithmetic if necessary (e.g., on Intel and SGI systems).
  asl.h, dtoa1.c: rather than redefining strtod (which causes some
systems to complain), #define strtod strtod_ASL.
  Readers: call qsortv rather than qsort (so just one efficient qsort
need be loaded).
  qp_read.c: "invisible" tweak to banish a compiler warning.

Mon Apr 12 15:38:16 EDT 1999
  writesol.c: fix a bug introduced in the changes of 19990206 that
could erroneously cause a "sos" suffix to be written to the .sol
file (when, e.g., nonconvex piecewise-linear terms are present) and
might have caused some other suffixes not to be returned.

Thu Apr 15 15:56:04 EDT 1999
  qp_read.c: the change on 19990409 was not invisible on machines with
64-bit pointers.  Today's change should correct this mistake.

Mon Apr 19 16:49:19 EDT 1999
 asl.h, jac0dim.c, sjac0dim.c, makefile*, amplsolv.*, studchk0.c: new
routine student_check_ASL(ASL *asl) (whose default version, in
studchk0.c, does nothing and whose "standard" alternative, in
sjac0dim.c, is equivalent to the old sjac0dim.c and limits problems
to 300 variables and 300 constraints), is a routine one can modify
to impose restrictions on "student" binaries.

Tue Apr 20 17:48:40 EDT 1999
  mip_pri.c: account for adjustments by suf_sos().  Note that we now
recommend use of the .priority suffix rather than mip_pri().
  printf.c: "invisible" tweak (introduction of stdout_fileno_ASL).

Wed Apr 28 10:44:10 EDT 1999
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix bug reading problems with defined
variables that can be split into sums of terms.  Incorrect gradients
or a fault during reading were possible.  Example:
	var x{i in 1..4} := i;
	var y{i in 1..2} = sum{j in 2*i-1..2*i} j*x[j];
	var z = y[1] / y[2];
	var w = sum{i in 1..3} x[i]*x[i+1];	# splits
	s.t. zot: z^2 <= 3;	# gradient was miscomputed
	s.t. zap: w >= x[3] + 1;
  suf_sos.c: honor Fortran: take asl->i.Fortran_ into account when
adjusting A_colstarts and A_rownos, and add Fortran = asl->i.Fortran_
to each number in sosbeg and sosind (in analogy with A_colstarts and
A_rownos).
  names.c, writesol.c: take variables and constraints eliminated by
suf_sos() into account (in the case of writesol, when wantsol bits 2
and/or 4 are one: the eliminated entities were already accounted for
in the .sol file).

Thu Apr 29 11:52:14 EDT 1999
  makefile.wat: add a backslash (missed in the changes of 19990415).

Fri Apr 30 13:59:40 EDT 1999
  nqpcheck.c: fix possible fault.  (Absent a fault, the bug was
harmless).
  New sigcatch_ASL() will catch various Unix signals and call
mainexit_ASL() and permit routines registered with atexit() to
be called when the solver is terminated by SIGABRT, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM,
or SIGHUP (unless SIGHUP is being ignored when sigcatch_ASL() is
called).

Fri May 21 17:20:01 EDT 1999
  qp_read.c: fix bug in qp_opify's handling of imported functions.
  readsol.c, rops.c, rops2.c: add some fflush(Stderr) calls.
  makefile: renamed makefile.u, so one can copy the appropriate
makefile.* to makefile, then edit makefile.
  printf.c, mainexit.c: for use by GUIs, compilation with -DPF_BUF of
amplsolver.a (or amplsolv.lib) and of solver interfaces causes
fprintf(stderr_ASL,...) to be accumulated in pfbuf_ASL (which is
allocated at the first relevant fprintf call and extended if necessary)
and, if pfbuf_print_ASL is not null, fflush(stderr_ASL) causes
pfbuf_print_ASL(pfbuf_ASL) to be called and pfbuf_ASL then to be freed.

Tue Jun  1 23:46:49 EDT 1999
  Tweaks for -DKR_headers; have equ_adjust() operate independently
of the presolve setting.

Thu Jun  3 14:19:03 EDT 1999
  makefile.u: correct comment about AIX to "for AIX versions < 4.3".

Sat Jun  5 16:24:52 EDT 1999
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix possible fault or worse during gradient
computations of an objective or constraint that makes nonlinear use
of a linear defined variable that depends on other (necessarily
linear) defined variables that do not otherwise appear in the
objective or constraint.  Example:
	var x{i in 1..2} := i + 1;
	var y = 1 - x[1];	# linear defined variable
	var z = y + 5;		# linear def. var., depending on y
	s.t. c: z*x[2]*(3 + 4*x[2]) = 0;	# nonlin. use of z
  conpval.c: fix bug in Jacobian computations after pfgh_read():
if a common expression appeared in two terms, one involving more
variables than the other, then the common expression's contribution
to first derivatives was counted twice.  Example: (x[1] + x[2] + 1) in
	var x{i in 1..4} := i + 1;
	s.t. c: (x[1] + x[2] + 1)*x[2] == (x[1] + x[2] + 1)*x[3]*x[4];

Thu Jun 17 11:42:59 EDT 1999
  func_add.c: minor cosmetic changes that only matter to pure C++
compilers; asldate.c not changed.

Thu Jun 17 18:41:38 EDT 1999
  rops.c, rops2.c: fix botch in "and" and "or" expressions (appearing
in the condition expression of nonlinear "if" expressions): the first
argument was passed as argument to the second operator.

Fri Jun 25 17:50:51 EDT 1999
  funcadd1.c: fix a (previously harmless) type error.
  names.c: fix a bug in obj_name().
  printf.c: add #ifdef USE_ULDIV logic for use on DEC Alpha machines
running some versions of OSF1.
  readsol.c: capture solve_result_num.

Wed Jun 30 16:12:12 EDT 1999
  pfghread.c: fix more bugs with linear defined variables.
Very simple ones were sometimes mishandled.  Example:
	# Jacobian matrix was miscomputed after pfgh_read()
	var x := 1; var a = x; var b = 1 - a;
	s.t. c: b*(x/x) - 3*b = 1;
Another example (different bug) with simple defined variables
in which the Jacobian matrix was miscomputed after pfgh_read():
	var x := 1; var y := 2; var z := 1;
	# variant: fix z;
	var v2 = z*y;
	var v3 = 1 - y;
	var v4 = v3;
	var v5 = x + v2;
	var v6 = (x + v2) / v5;
	var v7 = v4 / (v3+5);
	s.t. c: v6 + v7 = 1;
  readsol.c: "invisible" tweak (banish harmless warnings).

Fri Jul  9 08:34:57 EDT 1999
  xp2known.c: Fix a bug in computing constraint and objective values
after pfgh_read() with certain uses of very simple defined variables.
The bug is related to the one illustrated in the second example of
19990630, but not revealed by that example (but by a more complex one).

Wed Aug  4 09:02:13 EDT 1999
  xp1known.c: make changes analogous to those to xp2known.c on 19990709.
(This is for completeness; we know of no solver using this routine.)
  obj2val.c: omit an unnecessary "extern int errno;"; errno.h should
provide this (or the equivalent).
  func_add.c, funcadd1.c: unless there is a command-line -i option,
look first in $ampl_funclibs for imported functions; if $ampl_funclibs
is not available, look (as before) in $AMPLFUNC.  Starting with version
19990804, AMPL sets $ampl_funclibs to the full pathnames of the
libraries from which functions in the current problem instance were
imported.  Now -i, $ampl_funclibs, or $AMPLFUNC may contain a newline-
separated list of directories and file names, and the names may contain
internal spaces.
  funcadd.h: new fields in struct TableInfo have no affect on the
solver interface library.

Thu Aug  5 17:42:21 EDT 1999
  funcadd1.c, func_add.c: modify -i? output to tell about $ampl_funclibs
(and change some calling sequences).

Thu Aug 12 21:12:29 EDT 1999
  Minor tweaks...
  funcadd1.c: remove an unused variable.
  asl.h, jac0dim.c, stderr.c: provide for ill-advised systems (e.g.,
Red Hat Linux 6.0 for the DEC Alpha) in which static initializations
for the form "FILE *foo = stderr;" do not work: compiling the solver
interface library with -DNON_STDIO omits this sort of initialization,
which is replaced by a call on Stderr_init_ASL() in jac0dim().  Of
course, solvers that wish to do something with Stderr before
jac0dim has been called will have to first manually invoke (or do the
equivalent of) Stderr_init_ASL() when used on such inconvenient
systems.
  fpinit.c: tweak to compile under Red Hat Linux 6.0 for the DEC Alpha.
For older DEC Alpha versions of Linux, it may be necessary now to
compile fpinit.c with -DUSE_setfpucw .

Mon Sep 27 17:13:14 EDT 1999
  func_add.c, funcadd1.c: remember imported libraries and recall them
at any .nl-reader calls after the first (unless compiled with
-DCLOSE_AT_RESET).  This became necessary after the changes of 19990804.
  getstub.c, misc.c: add more calls on Stderr_init_ASL (cf the previous
changes).

Fri Oct  1 11:00:21 EDT 1999
 con[12]ival.c, objval.c: remove redundant #include "errno.h".
 rops.c, rops2.c, errchk.h: when errno is nonzero, add its
interpretation to error messages for library functions whose
evaluations fail.  (This may help detect spurious setting of errno.)

Thu Oct  7 18:01:56 EDT 1999
 rops.c, rops2.c: clear errno after calling an imported function.
 fg_read.c: "invisible" tweak to use op_type.o rather than op_type.hd.
 makefile.*: try to get dependencies right and omit obsolete names.

Thu Oct 14 00:26:12 EDT 1999
 Tweaks to many files:
1. Move errno = 0 assignments before x...check() calls, as these calls
   may evaluate common expressions.
2. Setting want_xpi0 |= 4 causes havex0 and havepi0 to be allocated
   when primal and dual initial guesses are present.
3. New, experimental routine fg_write can write a binary or ASCII .nl
   file, possibly adding new linear variables, constraints, objectives;
   normally used with new reader fg_wread(), a variant of fg_read()
   which, like qp_read(), leaves operation numbers rather than function
   pointers in the "op" fields.  (A subsequent call on qpopify() can
   make it possible to evaluate nonlinear expressions, but fg_write
   requires the operation numbers.)  New examples/nlcopy.c illustrates
   use of fg_wread and fg_write.
4. New bits in the flag argument to the .nl readers:
	ASL_keep_all_suffixes
	ASL_omit_all_suffixes
	ASL_keep_derivs
	ASL_allow_missing_funcs
	ASL_forbid_missing_funcs
   The first can be used by any reader (but is mostly for fg_wread);
the latter are only for fg_wread.

Fri Nov 19 16:55:10 EST 1999
  xectim.c: where possible, return the sum of user and system time,
rather than just user time.  On systems with slow software for
gradual underflow, it is possible to contruct examples where this
makes a significant difference in the reported times.

Mon Dec 13 17:00:00 EST 1999
  fpinit.c: tweak for Linux (e.g., S.u.S.E. 6.3, Red Hat 6.0);
asldate.c not changed.

Wed Dec 15 13:30:46 EST 1999
  dtoa.c, dtoa1.c: tweak to bypass a bug with HUGE_VAL on HP systems.

Thu Feb  3 23:18:24 EST 2000
  funcadd.h: new fields in AmplExports.
  asl.h and several *.c files: struct Edaginfo now has a pointer to
an AmplExports, rather than the complete structure, so that future
additions to AmplExports will not require recompiling everything.
This change does require make recompiling the whole library necessary,
as well as any solver objects that depend on asl.h or funcadd.h.
  New variant fpinitmt.c of fpinit.c for Win32 binaries; makefile.*
adjusted.

Thu Feb 10 17:31:13 EST 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix a bug (division by zero resulting in NaNs)
that arose in a complicated use of defined variables.
  sphes.c: fix a probably harmless reference to an uninitialized
variable.

Wed Feb 16 19:13:18 EST 2000
  nqpcheck.c: adjust to cope with <<0;0,0>>x*x with AMPL
versions < 20000216, which gave 0*x*x rather than 0.

Thu Feb 17 18:21:17 EST 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix a bug in handling sums of three or more
terms each involving a nonlinear expression with a sum of three or
more terms.  The bug caused a surprising error message in the example
that led to finding the bug, but could cause unpredictable behavior in
general.

Sun Mar  5 22:07:29 EST 2000
  objval.c: fix bug in evaluating defined variables: defined variables
appearing only in single constraints were evaluated during objective
function evaluations; under unusual conditions, this could lead
to an error being reported in the evaluation of the objective.
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix some bugs in Jacobian and Hessian
evaluations involving a defined variable that is an affine function
(linear function plus constant) of a single problem variable.
  makefile.u: comment on -DNON_STDOUT.
  func_add.c: add #ifdef NO_tempnam lines for systems without a
tempnam function.

Mon Mar  6 12:35:27 EST 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: minor "invisible" tweak to recycle a bit more
memory.

Wed Mar  8 13:49:57 EST 2000
  Fix minor printf glitch:
	printf "%.0f\n", .1;
printed "0." rather than "0" -- under "%.0f", numbers less than 1
in absolute value that do not round to 1 or -1 should print as "0"
with no trailing decimal point.

Wed Mar 15 12:42:05 EST 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix another botch with linear (affine)
defined variables: scaling was lost in linear references.  For
example, in
	var x; var y = 3*x; s.t. zot: sin(x) - 4*y == 1;
the factor (-4) in zot was lost.
  asl.h, con1ival.c, con2ival.c, con2val.c, conpval.c, conval.c,
obj2val.c, objval.c: tweaks to avoid redundant work with some
combinations of calls.
  fg_write.c, readsol.c: "invisible" cleanups.

Fri Mar 17 22:46:32 EST 2000
  arithchk.c, makefile.*: On Unix/Linux systems, account for the
effects of fpinit_ASL when deriving arith.h.  On SGI systems using
the n32 or 64 ABI, this causes Sudden_Underflow not to be #defined.

Sat Mar 18 23:22:24 EST 2000
  func_add.c: fix bug introduced 19990804 in handling imported
functions when two or more .nl readers are called.  (This affects
loqo, which may call both qp_read and pfgh_read.)

Mon Mar 20 16:55:45 EST 2000
  Minor tweaks for compilation with -DKR_headers (files asl.h,
fg_read.c, fg_write.c, func_add.c, funcadd1.c).

Mon Mar 27 01:33:59 EST 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix bugs in handling defined variables in
certain complicated situations (e.g., on Vanderbei's hs090.mod).  One
bug arose under AMPL's "option linelim 1".

Tue Mar 28 11:20:09 EST 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix glitch with nonlinear "if" expressions
with constant "then" or "else" expressions and with "min" or "max"
expressions having a constant operand: a fault was possible during
expression evaluations (after reading).

Tue Apr  4 11:52:52 EDT 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix yet another bug with defined variables:
if a nonlinear defined variable appeared linearly in an objective and
could be split into several terms, each depending on a different set
of variables, and if linear combinations of variables appeared
nonlinearly, incorrect derivative computations could result.

Thu Apr 27 19:17:20 EDT 2000
  New field AI of type AuxInfo* in AmplExports.  It can be assigned
by auxinfo_ASL() to provide general kinds of auxiliary information.
The (new) default auxinfo_ASL in amplsolver.a (amplsolv.lib) simply
assigns AI = 0, but solvers can provide their own auxinfo_ASL to
provide more interesting values.
  opcode.hd moved from directory ampl/solvers/nlc to ampl/solvers
for more convenient use by other solver drivers.

Wed May  3 07:53:14 EDT 2000
  New subdirectory lbfgsb with an interface to L-BFGS-B, which
minimizes or maximizes a differentiable objective subject only to
simple-bound constraints.  See Algorithm 778, ACM Trans. Math.
Software 23 #4 (1997), by Ciyou Zhu, Richard Byrd, Peihuang Lu,
and Jorge Nocedal.

Fri Jun  2 08:57:49 EDT 2000
  fpinit.c: new section for Solaris on i386 machines.
  New fpsetprec.s for use with fpinit.c on Solaris i386 systems.
  getstub.c: "invisible" tweak for readability.
  pfg_read.c pfghread.c: fix some bugs with defined variables:
definitions of the form
	var x = if something then 1 else 2;
where both the "then" and "else" clauses were constant almost
everywhere were mishandled, and
definitions that could be split apart (while identifying
partially separable structure) were sometimes mishandled.
Here is an example that caused a fault in pfgh_read():
	var a := 0; var b := 2; var c := 3;
	var x = if 2 <= a then 2 else b + c;
	var y = if 2 <= a then 0 else -2;
	var z = 2*x + y^2;
	minimize zot: z;

Thu Jun  8 19:13:13 EDT 2000
  func_add.c, funcadd.h: new ae->Getenv and #define for
	char* getenv(const char*)
mainly for use in AMPL sessions to let imported functions and table
handlers access the current environment (as modified by option,
environ, and problem commands).  Only use getenv in imported
functions (in the form (*al->Getenv)) if ae->ASLdate >= 20000608.
  func_add.c: fix glitch that could result in "_fileno" reported as
missing on some systems.

Mon Jul  3 11:44:29 EDT 2000
  Tweak to fpsetprec.s for use with fpinit.c on Solaris i386 systems.
(Adjust stack to allow interrupts to intervene in fpsetprec().)
  asl.h, basename.c, getstub.c: change "basename" to "basename_ASL",
to avoid (rare) trouble on hostile systems.
  rops.c, rops2.c: "invisible" tweak (change "round" to "Round") to
avoid trouble on other hostile systems.

Fri Jul  7 08:40:36 EDT 2000
  funcadd1.c: when loading a library to import functions, arrange for
subsequent unloading of the library to happen after any at_exit() or
at_reset() processing requested directly or indirectly by addfunc().
(This matters to an experimental facility for importing Java functions.)
  der0prop.c withdrawn (unused).
  Various files: adjustments to permit compilation by C++ compilers.

Thu Jul 20 11:03:28 EDT 2000
  basename.c: omit an 0x01 visible under -DKR_headers, introduced
on 20000707.
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix bug in handling nonlinear defined
variables that appeared linearly in an objective or constraint and
involved the sum of two or more terms involving different sets of
variables (so they could be split into a sum of defined variables
to make Hessian computations more efficient).  If introducing a
linear change of variables also helped and was discovered at the
"right" time, incorrect derivative computations resulted.  Example:
	var x{i in 0..2} := .1;
	var v3 = 1 / x[0];
	var v4 = x[1] + 5*x[2];
	var v5 = v3 - x[1]*v4;
	minimize foo: v5 + x[2]*v4;
Correcting this bug involved changing one line from
	ce->z.i = ka;
to
	ce->z.i = k < Ncom ? ka : ((expr_vx*)varp[k-Ncom])->a0;
but today's changes also include an "invisible" adjustment to the
a1 field of struct expr_vx.

Thu Jul 27 21:41:42 EDT 2000
  Extend comments in makefile.u about Solaris on the i386 architecture.

Thu Aug  3 13:44:35 EDT 2000
  funcadd1.c: mostly invisible addition of "#undef mymalloc".
  jac0dim.c, misc.c: move Stderr_init call to ASL_alloc() (a change
invisible on most systems, but relevant to some solvers, such as cplex,
on some Linux systems, if the solver issues an error message too soon).
  getstub.c: usage_ASL(): call Stderr_init if necessary.

Tue Aug 22 23:36:17 EDT 2000
  New genrowno.c defining gen_rownows_ASL (#defined as usual to
apparent prototype void gen_rownos(void)):  solvers that handle sparse
nonlinear constraints and wish to have Jacobian nonzeros stored
sparsely by columns in A_rownos may simply call gen_rownos() after
calling the .nl reader (with A_vals left at its default value = NULL).

Mon Aug 28 14:32:32 EDT 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix bug on systems with 64-bit addresses
that caused, e.g., miscomputation of gradients with problem "hs105"
(/netlib/ampl/models/nlmodels/hs105.mod).

Wed Aug 30 01:11:01 EDT 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix a bug with pfgh_read(nl, flags) when
one or both of the ASL_find_co_class bits of flags is on: wrong
c_class or o_class values (or a fault due to an out-of-bounds
subscript) could result if the bug bit.
  All readers: fix bug (out-of-bounds array reference) in some
cases when asl->i.nlvog has been assigned a positive value.
(Of the sample drivers in /netlib/ampl/solvers subdirectories,
only minos/m55.c and snopt/snopt.c do this.)
  jac0dim.c jacinc.c: adjust x0len to only consider nonlinear
variables when deciding whether nonlinear information must be updated.

Tue Sep  5 13:17:01 EDT 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix a bug in computing derivatives that
arose under complicated conditions:  a defined variable could be
split into the sum of two or more defined variables and appeared
in an expression complicated enough that "funneling" the expression
led to more efficient derivative computations.  Example:
	var x{1..2} >= .6 <= 1 := 1;
	var y{i in 1..2} = .5*x[i] + 1;
	var z{i in 1..2} = .25*y[i] + 3;
	var w =   (1 + (y[1] - y[2])^2) / z[2]	# split
		+ (y[1] - 7) / z[1];
	s.t. zot: w + x[1] + x[2] == 0;	# first term of w funneled

Tue Sep 12 15:38:38 EDT 2000
  nqpcheck.c:  for constraints, when a quadratic form involves a
constant term, update the constraint upper and lower bounds rather
than adjusting the value of the constraint body.

Mon Oct  2 15:45:39 EDT 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix bug only possible with inappropriate
use of "option presolve 0" resulting in constant "defined variables".
  All nonlinear .nl readers:  fix botch in computing bounds (LUrhs,
Urhsx) on constraints involved in complementarity conditions.  The
bounds were supposed to be redundant with those implied by the cvar
array.  Solvers, such as PATH, that just used the variable bounds
are unaffected by this bug fix.

Fri Oct  6 10:21:04 EDT 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: cope with 0*variable, which prior to AMPL
version 20001006 could arise from expressions of the form
v1*sum{i in A} p[i]*v[i], where v and v1 are variables and p[i] == 0
for all i.

Mon Oct  9 17:03:24 EDT 2000
  funcadd1.c: fix a possible fault with use of imported functions.
The fault, if it occurred, happened at the end of execution (except
under -DCLOSE_AT_RESET, when it happened when ASF_free was called).

Wed Nov  1 17:27:49 EST 2000
  mach.c:  tweak to prevent trouble with optimization by a very recent
version of gcc.
  dtoa.c: "invisible" tweaks (to be detailed in a forthcoming update
to /netlib/fp/changes).

Fri Nov  3 09:28:10 EST 2000
  funcadd.h: correct comment describing FUNCADD_012ARGS, which is for
*random* real valued functions; asldate.c not changed.
  dtoa.c: sync with /netlib/fp/dtoa.c

Fri Nov 10 17:43:07 EST 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix glitch with constant-valued defined
variables (which can arise with "option presolve 0" -- a bad
idea in general):  they were evaluated at twice their correct value.
  All nonlinear .nl readers:  in calls on imported functions with
expressions involving variables in the argument list (so al->derivs
and, if relevant, al->hes will be nonzero), initialize all components
of al->derivs and al->hes to zero.  Previously, only the al->hes
components were so initialized.

Mon Nov 13 22:54:19 EST 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix a performance bug with defined variables
that sometimes resulted in explicit constant zeros in sparse Hessians.
The bug bit when, say, the objective made linear reference to a defined
variable that itself was the (possibly weighted) sum of defined
variables.  Example:
	param N default 3; set I := 1..N;
	set T default 1..2; set P := {i in I, j in i+1..N};
	var d{P,T} >= 0.01 := 1;
	var p{(i,j) in P, k in T} = (i+j)/d[i,j,k];
	var r{k in T} = 12*sum{(i,j) in P} p[i,j,k];
	var t = sum{k in T} 2*r[k];
	minimize zap: .05*t;
The computed Hessian had explicit zeros in the (i,j) positions for
all i < j.

Wed Nov 15 17:40:13 EST 2000
  nqpcheck.c: fix bug in handling defined variables that are the sum of
two or more quadratic terms.  Example where the bug bit:
	set I := 1..2; var x{i in I} := i;
	var y = 7*sum{i in I} (x[i]/(i+1))^2;
	minimize zot: 10*y;
On this example, ampl/solvers/examples/qtest reported objective value
17.5 rather than 48.6111111111111.
  misc.c:  correct names in some error messages for incorrect usage
(calls out of sequence).

Fri Nov 17 16:57:18 EST 2000
  fg_read.c: fix a bug that could only manifest itself under unusual
circumstances:  calling fg_read() after assigning want_derivs = 0, with
top-level "if" or "min" or "max" expressions, as in "nlc -1 foo", where
foo.nl comes from
	var x {1..3}; s.t. c: min (x[1],x[2],x[3]) = 5;
  misc.c: banish register declarations ("invisible" tweak).

Thu Dec 28 18:44:14 EST 2000
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix a bug in handling chains of defined
variables of the form v[i+1] = v[i].  The smallest known example
where the bug bit is the rather baroque
	var v0 >= 0 := .02;
	var v1 >= 0 := 13.23;
	var v2 := -1.288;
	var v3 := -1.288;
	var v4 >= 0 := 13.23;
	var v5 = .5*v0*(v2 - 1.288);
	var v6 = v5 + .5*v0*(v2 + v3);
	var v7 = v6 + .5*v0*(v3 - 1.288);
	var v8 = v7;
	var v9 = v8;
	var v10 = v9;
	minimize zot: v4;
	s.t. c0: 60.536*v0 - v10 = 100;
	s.t. c1: -.5*v0*(v1 + 13.23) = -.2646;
When it bit, the bug caused incorrect Jacobian evaluations.

Tue Jan  2 18:51:43 EST 2001
  asl.h:  tweak to permit making Win32 DLLs that access stdio by
starting with
	#define NO_STDIO1
	#define Permit_AE_redefs
	#include "asl.h"
and arranging separately to make "ae" visible; asldate.c not changed.

Mon Jan 15 17:09:34 EST 2001
  conpval.c, pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix Hessian bug in handling
	unary(unary(terms(x))
where terms(x) is the sum of two or more terms involving different
subsets of the variables x.  Example:

	var x{1..2} := .5; minimize zot: sin(-(x[1] + x[2]));

Note the -(), i.e., negation, is a unary function.

Tue Jan 16 13:30:39 EST 2001
  rops.c, rops2.c:  reorder partial derivative computations for
x^y and x^c (constant power) to avoid trouble when x^y or x^c
underflows to zero.

Wed Feb  7 13:15:13 EST 2001
  dtoa.c, dtoa1.c, atof.c: obscure bug fixes (see /netlib/fp/changes).

Thu Mar 22 14:07:07 EST 2001
  funcadd.h: fix a typo in a comment (s/funcadd/addfunc/).
  misc.c: tweak to permit reading ASCII .nl files massaged to have
either Microsoft (\r\n) or Macintosh (\r) end-of-line notation.

Fri Apr 27 18:01:04 EDT 2001
  suf_sos.c: fix a glitch that will matter to MIP solvers that handle
SOS2 sets once AMPL's forthcoming "variable in union of intervals"
extension is available.  A fault was possible.

Wed May  9 23:36:02 EDT 2001
  printf.c:  Have printf("%s",0) print "<NULL>" rather than fault.
This affects both solvers and imported (user-defined) functions.
  funcadd.h: add some #ifdef _WIN32 goo for added flexibility.

Thu May 10 17:34:16 EDT 2001
  qp_read.c: fix a bug in qp_opify that would cause a fault when it bit.
  con1ival.c, con2ival.c, conpval.c, conpvaldb.c, obj2val.c, objval.c:
trivial adjustment:  use M1zapalloc() instead of M1alloc and memset.

Wed May 23 13:16:03 EDT 2001
  suf_sos.c:  fix bug (mis-ordered statements) that could bite on
problems with both nonconvex piecewise-linear terms (linearized by
AMPL) and explicit .sosno and .ref suffixes.  When processing .sosno
and .ref, sort SOS1 members on increasing .ref values.  Adjust for
possible use with nonlinear solvers:  if A_vals is null, adjust Cgrad
and con_de to reflect removed constraints.
  asl.h, suf_sos.c:  add recognition of bit ASL_suf_sos_just_SOS1
in the flags argument to suf_sos().  If this bit is set, SOS2
constraints added by AMPL while transforming nonconvex piecewise-
linear terms are retained and just the associated SOS1 constraint
is removed.
  getstub.h, value.c: add FI_val for a fint value in a known place.
  sphes.c: in the call sphes(h, no, ow, y), if 0 <= no < n_obj and ow
is nonzero, use weight ow[no] rather than 1. for the objective.
  fpinit.c, makefile.u:  for more flexibility on Linux systems, add
"#ifndef NO_fpu_control" logic to fpinit.c and a comment on it to
makefile.u.

Thu May 24 08:45:36 EDT 2001
  suf_sos.c:  change to ASL_suf_sos_just_SOS1 bit: if on, retain all
constraints added when linearizing nonconvex piecewise-linear terms.

Thu May 31 17:10:29 EDT 2001
  conpval.c objval.c xp[12]known.c:  add some missing "err_jmp = 0"
assignments (to prevent trouble under unusual conditions -- most
solvers are unaffected).
  Sundry files:  adjust all Hessian computations to treat arguments
(nobj, ow) the same as in last week's change to sphes.c:  if ow is
nonzero and 0 <= nobj < n_obj, use weight ow[nobj] rather than 1.
Also add interlocks to make it true for sphes() that the Hessian is
computed at the most recent primal variables x passed to any of the
function or gradient routines (congrd, conival, conval, jacval,
objgrd, or objval) or to xknown() or xknowne().  Hitherto explicit
previous gradient computations were required on problems with "group"
partially separable structure.

Fri Jun  1 11:38:31 EDT 2001
  Fix glitches in compilation with -DKR_headers.
  Correct yesterday's changes to make Hessian computations right when
nonlinear gradients of relevant functions lacking "group" partially
separable structure have not been computed at the current x.
  For hvcomp(), assigning asl->i.x_known = 2 before a series of calls
on hvcomp turns off the tests that would bring gradient information
up to date.  This saves overhead and is appropriate if the program
logic ensures that all relevant gradients have been computed at the
current x.  If you do this, be sure to invoke "xunknown();" after the
series of hvcomp calls.
  Header file changes yesterday and today make it necessary to recompile
solver source files that include asl_pfgh.h or jacpdim.h.

Sat Jun  2 01:01:42 EDT 2001
  Shortly after the previous update, Bob Vanderbei reported a new bug:
after pfgh_read(), first derivatives were miscomputed when a unitary
function was applied to a sum of three or more nonlinear terms, two
or more of which involved the same "internal variables", such as
x+y and x-y in the following simple example:
	var x := -1; var y := 1;
	minimize f: sqrt((sin(x+y) + (y-x))^2 + (y-x+1)^2);

Sat Jun  2 17:07:48 EDT 2001
  conpval.c:  fix a new fault with calls on duthes, fullhes, sphes, or
hvcomp with y = 0.
  asl.h: add #define for hvinit() with apparent prototype
	void hvinit(int nobj, real *ow, real *y)
which should be called before hvcomp when calling hvcomp at the same
x (primal variable values) but different (nobj, ow, y).
  objval_.c: add corresponding Fortran (f77) callable
	subroutine hvinit(nobj, ow, y)
	integer nobj
	double precision ow(*), y(*)
  duthes.c, fullhes.c, sphes.c and xp2known.c:  change default hesset()
calls to make all nonlinear objectives and constraints available for
Hessian computations.  Though not yet described in "Hooking Your
Solver to AMPL", hesset() with apparent prototype
	void hesset(int flags, int obj, int nnobj, int con, int nncon)
has long been #defined in asl.h.  It must be called once after
pfgh_read() to indicate which objectives and constraints will
participate in Hessian computations:  objectives obj <= i < obj + nnobj
and constraints con <= i < con + nncon will subsequently be considered
(with obj = 0 for the first constraint and con = 0 for the first
objective).  Currently, the flags argument should be 1.  Since
problems may be declared to have more than one objective, when
treating objective nobj (0 <= nobj < n_obj), it is best to invoke
        hesset(1,nobj,1,0,nlc) after pfgh_read() so only the desired
objective will affect the sparsity pattern presented to the solver
(when using sphes()).  When there is no objective, use
obj = nnobj = 0, as in hesset(1,0,0,0,nlc).

Thu Jun  7 17:37:42 EDT 2001
  asl.h, pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  change to interpretation of flags
argument to pfg_read and pfgh_read:  unless ASL_find_default_no_groups
appears in flags, assume ASL_findgroups.  When
ASL_find_default_no_groups appears, only explicit specifications of
ASL_findOgroups, ASL_findCgroups or ASL_findgroups are now honored.
Thus pfgh_read(nl,0) would now be "normal" usage, as it's generally
desirable to have the increased efficiency that finding group
structure can bring.  One exception is lancelot, which only wants
to see group structure for objectives.  The sample driver for
lancelot is updated accordingly.

Fri Jun 15 13:44:38 EDT 2001
  conpval.c:  fix a glitch in the changes of 20010531:  objgrd rather
than congrd was called to compute partials needed for Hessian
computations (under apparently unusual conditions).  In the example
behind this correction, the bug caused the surprising error message
	objpgrd: got NOBJ = 1; expected 0 <= NOBJ < 1

Tue Jun 19 00:41:37 EDT 2001
  makefile.u: change "a.out" to "./a.out" (in case $PATH excludes ".").

Wed Jun 20 16:36:55 EDT 2001
  fpinit.c:  use IEEE default exception mask with FreeBSD.

Mon Jun 25 15:11:43 EDT 2001
  arithchk.c, makefile.u:  add (undesirable) #ifdefs to simplify
makefile modifications needed for Intel Solaris.

Mon Aug 13 23:47:27 EDT 2001
  fpinit.c, funcadd1.c, makefile.*:  omit WIN32 in favor of _WIN32
(which is predefined by the WIN32 compilers in WIN32 mode).
  fpinit.c: provide "#ifdef ASL_NO_FP_INIT" for examples/amplfunc.c.
  examples/amplfunc.c and spamfunc.c: under _WIN32, include fpinit.c
with ASL_NO_FP_INIT #defined (to prevent possible surprises).
  No change to asldate.c.

Thu Aug 23 09:42:07 EDT 2001
  suf_sos.c: When processing .sosno and .ref, if .priority is available,
give each SOS1 and SOS2 set specified by .sosno the maximum priority
of any of its variables (rather than the minimum).

Wed Feb  6 16:57:53 EST 2002
  New function int_catch(void(*f)(int,void*), void *v) lets a solver
interface provide a function f such that f(SIGINT,v) should be
invoked the first time a SIGINT signal is received.  This could
instruct the solver to terminate gracefully.  Argument v is passed
without change to f.  Imported functions can also call f as follows:

	AmplExports *ae = al->AE;
	if (ae->ASLdate >= 20011004 && ae->Breakfunc)
		(*ae->Breakfunc)(2, ae->Breakarg);

  Fix glitches with printf:
	printf "%3.0f\n", .1;	# gave " 0" rather than "  0"
	printf "%3.-2f\n", 1;	# gave "   00" rather than "  0"
  Fix a memory leak that occurred when sphes_setup() was called with
several times with different arguments.
  Fix a fault in pfg_read() and pfgh_read() in handling a nonlinear
defined variable involving (variable expression)*(sum of nonlinear
terms), where the linear terms cancel or there are two or more
explicit zeros in certain positions.  Example (that results in two
explicit zeros with AMPL versions prior to 20011218):
	set I := 1..5;
	var w{I} := 2 >= 0 <= 5;
	var x{I} := 1 >= 0 <= 4;
	var y <= 4 := 1;
	var z = y * sum{i in I} i*w[i]*x[i];
	maximize zot: y*z;
	s.t. zap: z <= 10;
	s.t. fix25{i in {2,5}}: x[i] = 0;
Here is a uuencoded, gzipped foo.nl resulting from the above with
	option nl_comments 1;
	write gfoo;
(with an AMPL version prior to 20011218):

end

  Adjust arithchk.c so it will emit #define NANCHECK in at
least some cases when the math library fails to set errno.
README is correspondingly modified.
  asl.h, suf_sos.c:  the ASL_suf_sos_just_SOS1 flags bit is
withdrawn.  In its place is a new routine, sos_add() (source
file sos_add.c) for use by solvers that handle integer variables
and perhaps know about SOS1 constraints, but do not fully
support SOS sets -- e.g., do not supply the convexity constraint
that implies the SOS1 condition.  For such solvers, one now invokes

	void *SI = sos_add(nl,flags);

before calling the .nl reader.  This routine scans the incoming
suffixes and arranges for the .nl reader to leave room for adding
constraints and variables needed to properly treat .sosno and .ref.
After calling the .nl reader, one then invokes either

	nsos = sos_finish(&SI, flags, &nsosnz, &sospri, copri, &sosbeg,
		&sosind, &sosref);

if the solver wants to know about SOS1 constraints, or

	sos_finish(&SI, flags, 0,0,0,0,0,0);

if not.  Both sos_finish invocations are no-ops, returning 0, if SI
is null.  When SI is not null, both may adjust n_con, nzc, etc.

  func_add.c: on Linux systems, supply private tempnam and tmpnam
(which are only there in case imported functions want to use them on
Microsoft systems) to banish warnings about use of dangerous functions.

Tue Feb 12 08:29:04 EST 2002
  fgh_read.c:  omit a check that printed Cgrad[nnn] = 0 on trivial
constraints (that are eliminated unless one inappropriately specifies
"option presolve 0").
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix a bug in pfgh_read() whereby partially
separable constant terms other than numerical constants were treated as
zero.  Such terms can arise when one (inappropriately) specifies
"option presolve 0" in examples with defined variables and fixed
variables, such as

	var x{i in 0..2} := i;
	var y = x[1] - x[2];
	var z = y^2;
	minimize f: x[0]^2 + z;
	fix {i in 1..2} x[i];

and in examples with imported functions that are unavailable to the
AMPL processor (but available to the solver), as in

	function ginv; var x;
	minimize zot: (x-1)^2 + ginv(2);

  makefile.u: add sos_add.c to the rule for xsum.out.

Thu Feb 21 14:07:02 EST 2002
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix longstanding bug in handling unary
minus in some contexts:  too much got negated (by pfg_read() and
pfgh_read()).  An example where the bug bit:

	var x := 1; var y := sin(-1.5);
	s.t. c1: sin(-.5 + -x) == y;

Tue Apr  9 18:44:03 EDT 2002
  writesol.c:  when invoked by AMPL versions >= 20020401, omit
the backspaces that hitherto appeared when properly behaving
solvers did not report any option settings.
 fgh_read.c: omit an unused variable.

Mon Apr 22 11:13:39 EDT 2002
  sos_add.c:  fix bugs in handling fewer new variables than might have
been required (because some turned out already to be binary) and in
working with pfg_read() and pfgh_read().

Tue Apr 30 18:22:33 EDT 2002
  getstub.c:  extend Ver_val (for "version") to accept an optional
value (as in "version=1").
  value.c:  use *(unsigned char*) in some comparisons (an invisible
change with ASCII characters).

Tue May  7 15:58:54 EDT 2002
  funcadd.h, func_add.c, printf.c, stdio1.h:  make C99 snprintf and
vsnprintf available to imported functions when ae->ASLdate >= 20020501.
  New source file details.c0 meant for conversion to details.c either
automatically (under Linux and Unix, where the makefile can use sed
and "uname -sr"), or by hand editing (on Microsoft systems).  Ver_val
now uses char sysdetails_ASL[] (unless it is ""), which can be
supplied by details.c or by individual drivers.
  getstub.[ch]: new field driver_date in Option_Info: if positive,
its decimal value should be a date string YYYYMMDD, which will appear
with command-line option -v or keyword "version" (if associated with
Ver_val -- the recommended arrangement).
  In the sample drivers in the ampl/solvers subdirectories, YYYYMMDD
has now been derived automatically by the mkfile rule
	sed "s/YYYYMMDD/`Dt -8 $prereq`/" $prereq >$target
and explicitly loading $S/sjac0dim.o (or $S/sjac0dim.obj) to make a
student version causes "-v" and "version" output to mention "Student ".
  sos_add.c and the .nl readers:  correct dmg misunderstanding of SOS1
sets:  at most one variable in an SOS1 set should be nonzero, rather
than exactly one.  Fix a glitch (leading to an error message about a
bad .nl file) using sos_add on problems with defined variables.

Wed May  8 16:53:58 EDT 2002
  sos_add.c, suf_sos.c: adjust to avoid a fault when used with a
forthcoming AMPL extension for "var in union_of_intervals".

Mon Jun 17 14:07:07 EDT 2002
  getstub.c:  if $solver_msg is an odd positive integer (such as 1),
suppress the initial "($solver): " and the echoing of solver options.

Sat Jul 13 12:27:02 EDT 2002
  printf.c: "invisible" internal tweak (reflected in asldate = 20020627).
  funcadd1.c: add "#ifdef __APPLE__" stuff for Macintosh OS X.

Mon Aug 19 12:17:51 EDT 2002
 funcadd.h: add const qualifier to char **sa; asldate.c not changed.

Wed Aug 28 23:13:50 EDT 2002
  fg_read.c, fgh_read.c, pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: tweak in response to
const qualifier added to funcadd.h on 20020819.
  Obscure bug fix to printf.c, affecting printf, fprintf, sprintf:
on systems with IEEE arithmetic, get an explicitly requested sign of
zero right under format %+e, e.g., in printf("%+e\n", -0).

Thu Sep  5 16:12:38 EDT 2002
  Fix a glitch in rarely used routines (xknown and xknowne used with
fgh_read()):  in x2check.c, supply a missing reset of asl->i.err_jmp_.
  Fix bugs with calling evaluation routines with nerror nonnull and
nonnegative, receiving an evaluation error, then calling another
evaluation routine with nerror null or negative and receiving another
error.  (Such sequences seem unlikely and do not occur in the sample
solver drivers in subdirectories of ampl/solvers.)

Mon Sep 16 12:57:14 EDT 2002
  Trivial change to a format in getstub.c (having no effect with
ordinary use of the solver interface library, which uses fprintf =
Fprintf supplied by the library); asldate.c not changed.

Mon Sep 23 16:30:33 EDT 2002
  conpval.c: fix bug in objgrd(np,x,g,nerror) when np > 1 and
pfgh_read() is the .nl reader.  The linear terms from the first
objective, rather than objective np, were used.

Wed Nov 13 16:45:28 EST 2002
  Fix a bug with use of at_exit() or at_reset() in imported functions:
the library was freed before the functions registered with at_exit
or at_reset were called, sometimes leading to a fault.

Tue Feb  4 23:05:51 EST 2003
  makefile.u: add comments for cygwin and MinCW.
  makefile.vc: add comments for lcc.
  fpinit.c and fpinitmt.c: minor portability tweaks.
  sos_add.c: omit an unused static function.
  Sundry files:  updated for CLP extensions (to be documented
elsewhere).  Recompile everything that depends on header files
in the solvers directory.

Thu Mar 20 22:50:38 EST 2003
  value.c:  fix a glitch in FI_val's handling of "?" values (which
are supposed to request printing of the current value of the option in
question):  bogus values were reported.  FI_val is for Fortran integer
values; only a few solvers (such as filter and minlp) use it.

Thu May 29 17:44:56 EDT 2003
  conpval.c:  fix a bug that could lead to a surprising error message
of the form "objpgrd: got NOBJ = 12; expected 0 <= NOBJ < 1" if a
Hessian computation was requested after a function evaluation at
a point different from the one where the most recent gradient
evaluation took place.  Also with .nl reader pfgh_read(), fix a bug
with objgrd(np,x,g,ne) with non-null ne (and *ne >= 0) and np != 0
(i.e., when treating an objective other than the first):  wrong
results may have been computed.

Sat Oct 18 22:06:09 EDT 2003
  conpval.c, pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix a bug in handling partially
separable functions where an unset variable could cause unnecessary
re-evaluations (or under just the right conditions, missed evaluations)
of parts of the derivatives.

Fri Dec  5 07:28:06 MST 2003
  Tweaks to asl.h and sphes.c so when uptri (final arg to sphsetup) is 2,
sphes computes the sparse lower triangle of the Hessian (stored column-wise).

Thu Jan 22 00:58:11 MST 2004
  jac0dim.c:  make bswap visible as bswap_ASL (for use in a forthcoming
addition to solvers/examples).
  writesol.c: similary make new write_solx_ASL visible (able to byte-swap
while writing).
  comptry.bat:  adjust to permit lots of stuff in CFLAGS (thanks to Erling
Andersen for this suggestion).

Sun Feb  8 23:07:16 MST 2004
  sphes.c:  fix a botch in sphes_setup's handling of problems with
multiple objectives and arguments (nobj and y) indicating that just
one of the objectives is to be used or that constraints are to be
ignored in the Hessian:  the sparsity pattern was overestimated
(encompassing the undesired objectives and constraints).

Wed Mar 24 00:42:30 MST 2004
  sphes.c:  omit declaration of unused variables hr1, hr2;
asldate.c not changed.

Sun Apr 11 23:39:41 MDT 2004
  dtoa.c:  update contact info. for dmg and correct page numbers in
comment on Steele & White (1990); asldate.c not changed.

Sat Aug 21 22:04:17 MDT 2004
  makefile.u: minor tweak to permit "make ARFLAGS='-X64  ruv'" (after
one has copied makefile.u to makefile and made other necessary changes).
  getstub.c: add Lic_info_ASL, a char* value that can be set to have
show_version_ASL() print license information.
  pfg_read.c pfghread.c, pshvprod.c: fix bugs (e.g., faults on some
problems) with hvcomp.

Wed May 11 23:12:43 MDT 2005
  sprintf.c: omit an unused variable.
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: use size_expr_n (for benefit of a possible
forthcoming nlc extension).
  misc.c: fix a glitch that only matters with -DNO_STDIO1.

Sat Jun 25 23:59:06 MDT 2005
  funcadd.c: add a const qualifier to a local variable in function mean().
  *read.c: when linear complementarity constraints are present, fold any
nonzero right-hand side values into the bounds (LUrhs, Urhsx) on the
constraint.  Some solvers expect the constant term in linear constraints
to be zero, which was always true except for linear complementarity
constraints.  New bit ASL_no_linear_cc_rhs_adjust in the flags argument
to the .nl readers suppresses this adjustment.

20051128
  stderr.c, makefile.u: omit possible need for compilation with -DNON_STDIO.
  getstub.c, punknown.c: portability tweaks for systems with 64-bit pointers
(cast to (int) differences in pointers used as arguments for .* format items).
  xectim.c: obscure tweak to use CLOCKS_PER_SEC in an unusual case.

20060122
  func_add.c, funcadd.h: adjust to use size_t rather than unsigned long for
sizes, to allow allocating huge memory blocks on 64-bit systems.
  makefile.vc:  add XBINLIBS (an empty string) and comments about
modifying it for MS VC++ 7.

20060423
  names.c:  change _slcon to _slogcon (in names for logical constraints
when no .row file is present).

20061007
  fg_read.c fgh_read.c pfg_read.c pfghread.c: adjust to handle long
character strings (>= 80 characters) in arguments to imported
functions when reading ASCII .nl files ("g" format).  Long strings in
the default binary ("b") format were already correctly handled.
  arithchk.c:  when using binary IEEE (P754) arithmetic, emit #defines
for a quiet NaN (a facility not yet used in the ASL or examples thereof).

20061119
  fg_read.c fgh_read.c pfg_read.c pfghread.c: only attempt to load
amplfunc.dll if the .nl file references imported functions.
  fpintit.c fpinitmt.c: tweaks for cygwin.
  New files configure and configurehere.  Invoke ./configure to create
$OBJDIR/amplsolver.a (with OBJDIR = sys.`uname -m`.`uname -s` unless
otherwise specified).  Variants of amplsolver.a for several systems
can thus be created in system-specific $OBJDIR directories.  Invoking
./configurehere creates "makefile" as per former practice.
  rops.c rops2.c:  for functions such as objval and objgrd that
take nerror as an argument, set *nerror = 2 when the function but
not its gradient can be computed.  In this case, if you assign

	want_deriv = 0;
	x0kind = ASL_first_x;

and repeat the function evaluation, it will succeed (barring subsequent
detection of another error), but gradient evaluations will not work
properly.  To restore gradient computations, assign

	want_deriv = 1;
	x0kind = ASL_first_x;

before any gradient computations.  (For Hessian evaluations to work
right, want_deriv = 1 must be in effect during the related function
evaluations.)

20061125
  README: document ./configure and ./configurehere.
  configurehere, makefile.u: adjustments for MinGW.

20070124
  funcadd1.c:  __APPLE__ (for stuff necessary with earlier versions
of MacOSX -- how early is unclear) changed to Old_APPLE.  Error-message
glitch (possible fault, depending on the compiler) fixed.
  fpecatch.c, asl.h:  move definition of fpe_jmpbuf here,
renamed fpe_jmpbuf_ASL and now declared in asl.h.  (This is mainly of
interest on the now rarely seen systems that do not use IEEE
arithmetic.  Examples of use appear in the sample minos and snopt
drivers.)

20070611
  configure: correct a comment (omit "and maybe MacOSX").
  wrtsol_.c: add variant wrsolw_ of wrtsol_ with Fortran signature

	subroutine wrsolw(msg, nlines, x, y, wantsol)
	integer nlines, wantsol
	character*(*) msg(nlines)
	double precision x(*), y(*)

and new final argument wantsol, with value the sum of

	1	for write the .sol file
	2	for writing x (primal variables) to stdout
	4	for writing y (dual variables) to stdout

Change wrtsol_ so the Fortran "call wrtsol(msg, nlines, x, y)"
is the same as "call wrsolw(msg, nlines, x, y, 7)".  (Previously wrtsol
acted like wrsolw with wantsol == 3 rather than 7.)
  New source file jacinc1.c adds jacinc1_ for a Fortran-callable variant
of jacinc(...), with Fortran signature

	subroutine jacinc1(M,N,NO,NZ,JP,JI,X,L,U,Lrhs,Urhs,Inf,Objdir)
	integer M, N, NO, NZ, JP(N+1), JI(NZ), Objdir(NO)
	double precision X(N), L(N), U(N), Lrhs(M), Urhs(M), Inf

Compared with jacinc_(), jacinc1_() has two extra arguments, NO
and Objdir, with (in Fortran syntax, with first subscript == 1)
Objdir(i) == 0 if objective i is to be minimized and
Objdir(i) == 1 if objective i is to be maximized, 1 <= i <= NO.
Also, JP is of type INTEGER rather than INTEGER*2.
Input arguments M, N, NO, NZ are not currently checked for validity.
  New source file jac2dim.c adds jac2dim_ for a Fortran callable variant
of jacdim_ with Fortran signature

	subroutine jac2dim(stub, M, N, NO, NZ, MXROW, MXCOL)
	integer M, N, NO, NZ, MXROW, MXCOL
	character*(*) stub

(same signature as jacdim_), which arranges for function, gradient,
and Hessian evaluations rather than just the function and gradient
evaluations made available by jacdim.
  stderr.c: add some #ifdef _WIN32 goo so error messages won't fault
when the solver-interface library is in a .dll, e.g., when used in a
MATLAB mex function.
  rops.c, rops2.c:  make a couple of things (f_OPVARVAL in rops.c,
f_OPIMPELSE in rops2.c) externally visible (not file static), in an
attempt to bypass a bug in the linker of Microsoft Visual C++ 8.

20070618
  fpinitmt.c:  change "#ifdef WATCOM" to "#ifdef oldWATCOM", to avoid
trouble with the current Open Watcom 1.6.
  arithchk.c: "invisible" tweaks to banish some compiler warnings.
  rops2.c:  Fix bug in Hessians that involve tanh.

20070619
  rops2.c: fix bug in Hessians involveing sinh(x) for x < 0.

20070630
  configurehere: tweak for Alpha systems, to get CFLAGS right when
cc == gcc.

20070805
  sjac0dim.c:  add fflush(Stderr) invocation, which matters with MiNGW;
asldate.c not changed -- this only affects student binaries.

20070809
  funcadd.h:  supply a missing */ that only matters for a forthcoming
feature.

20070827
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c: fix a fault in Hessian computations involving
max or min functions of two arguments.

20070905
  Update netlib URLs and some access details in
	README
	donlp2/README
	examples/README
	minos551/README.1st
	nlc/README

20070913
  dtoa.c, dtoa1.c: make INFNAM_CHECK the default to avoid surprises
(since the strtod() logic this implies has been in the C99 standard
for some years now).

20070922
  xp2known.c:  fix a bug that caused a fault in hvcomp on certain
(unusual) problems.

20071029
  jacinc1.c: omit an unused file-static routine.
  fpinitmt.c: tweak for use with (new makefile variant) makefile.lc.
  makefile.u: adjust xsum computation to include makefile.lc.
  makefile.lc: new makefile variant for use with the PC version of
lcc available from http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/ .  Note
that lcc's -O misbehaves on some of the source files.

20071103
  asl.h, writesol.c:  write_solx_ASL replaced by write_solf_ASL and
write_solfx_ASL (the former soon to be used in an updated
cplex/cplex.c, the latter in an eventually forthcoming
examples/solconv.c).

20071111
  Add AVL-tree routines (source = avltree.[ch]), for expected later use.

20071118
  Make AVL-tree routines politically correct w.r.t. const; add
avldelete.c for AVL_delete(...).

20071122
  New source file fpsetprec64.s, mentioned in updated makefile.u, for
use with Solaris and -xarch=generic64 or -xarch=amd64; asldate.c not
changed.

20071128
  "Invisible" tweaks to avldelete.c, fg_read.c, pfg_read.c to banish
warnings of unused variables.

20071201
  misc.c: add "#ifdef _WIN32" stuff to f_OPNUM_ASL to circumvent a
Microsoft linker bug (seen under MSVC6 and MSVC8).

20071210
  configurehere: adjust for Solaris on Intel (x86) processors.
  fpinit.c: adjust for Linux on PowrPC.
  asldate.c: not changed.

20071215
  avltree.c avltree.h:  Adjust to permit use independent of the
AMPL/solver interace library.

20080101
  value.c:  Extend C_val so =?  will show the current value, which
will either be <NULL> (with no quotes) or a string enclosed in double
quotes, within which " is represented as "", i.e., is doubled.  Allow
values for C_val to be enclosed in single or double quotes, in which
case the quoting character can appear within the string if it is
doubled, so "a funny ""value""" and 'a funny "value"' are treated
alike.

20080119
  fpinit.c:  tweak to fix a #define glitch when making arith.h under
AIX; asldate.c not changed.

20080204
  avltree.[ch]:  add AVL_Tree_alloc2() for supplying free() (for
debugging); asldate.c not changed.

20080229
  con2val.c:  Have jac2dim_ASL call pfgh_read() rather than fgh_read()
(for consistency with the Fortran wrapper in jac2dim.c).

20080302
  stderr.c:  add an explict "= 0" to "FILE *Stderr;" to circumvent
a bug with gcc on Macintosh systems; asldate.c not changed.

20080315
  dtoa.c: obscure change (to C99 spec) in handling of NaN(...), a
change unlikely to affect solvers, but asldate.c nonetheless updated.

20080413
  makefile.u:  add comment about -D_NONSTD_SOURCE for MacOSX.

20080414
  misc.c:  adjust "bad line" error message to show the whole offending
line for 'g'-mode (ASCII) .nl files.

20080612
  fpinit.c:  tweak __linux__ case to work when _FPU_IEEE is not
#defined; asldate.c not changed.

20080629
  configurehere: addition for MacOSX.
  sphes.c: fix bug in sphsetup (computing the sparsity pattern of
the Lagrangian Hessian).  Under just the "right" conditions, some
nonzeros were missed.  Example:

	var x{i in 1..2} := i;
	minimize f: x[1]*x[2]*sin(x[1]-x[2]);

But with the sin term changed to sin(x[1]-p*x[2]) for any p different
from 1, the correct sparsity was detected.

20080630
  pshvprod.c:  fix a bug in Hessian computations:  in if-then-else
expressions with one constant "then" or "else" value (and the other
involving variables), a bogus nonzero value (such as 7.90505e-323) was
mistakenly used instead of zero when the constant value was selected.
An example where the bug bit (at the default x == y == 0):

	var x; var y;
	minimize f2: x*(if y > 3 then x*y else 2);

20080701
  funcadd.h: adjust calling sequence of function type AddRand
(which is not yet used, but is planned for use.)

20070707
  misc.c: tweak a comment.
  asl.h: change Intcast from (int) to (size_t) in hopes of fewer
warnings on 64-bit machines; asldate.c not changed.
  fg_write.c: tweak definition of offset_of to avoid warnings.

20080729
  fpinit.c:  add #ifdef goo for Itanium systems running ALTIX;
asldate.c not changed.

20080807
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix bug in pfghread()'s handling of
imported functions that had numeric constant arguments before
nonconstant ones:  partials for the nonconstant arguments were
incorrectly referenced.

20080808
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix another bug in pfghread()'s handling of
imported functions that had numeric constant arguments before
nonconstant ones:  second partials for the nonconstant arguments were
incorrectly referenced, affecting Hessian computations.

20080828
  rops2.c:  Fix a bug f_OPPOW (used with pfgh_read()): expressions of
the form x^y with x negative and y an integer were not diagnosed as
nondifferentiable, but instead gave NaNs in derivative computations.

20080907
  printf.c: add C99 %a and %A processing (on IEEE-arithmetic systems).

20081001
  funcadd.h: tweak for random functions (a forthcoming feature).
  configurehere: tweak to allow / in $CFLAGS.
  asldate.c: not changed.

20081105
  printf.c: add include arith.h (when NO_PRINTF_A_FMT is not defined).
  configurehere: tweak for MinGW.
  asldate.c not changed.

20081205
  dtoa.c:  add recognition of C99-style hexadecimal floating-point
values (unless compiled with NO_HEX_FP is #defined).
  dtoa1.c: move #include "stdlib.h" up, to avoid trouble with a recent
(2008) version of cygwin that gratuitously #includes stdlib.h.
  asl.h, misc.c: add functions ASL* get_cur_ASL(void) and
ASL* set_cur_ASL(ASL *) to get and set cur_ASL (with set_cur_ASL
returning the previous value).

20081211
  dtoa.c: omit an unused variable; asldate.c not changed.

20090102
  dtoa.c: tweak to banish some compiler warnings; asldate.c not changed.

20090316
  comeval.c, xp[12]known.c: fix glitch in assigning cv_index (used in
error messages for trouble evaluating defined variables).
  dtoa1.c, dtoa.c: sync with netlib/fp/dtoa.c.

20090414
  dtoa1.c, dtoa.c: sync with netlib/fp/dtoa.c; asldate.c not changed.

20090414
  dtoa1.c, dtoa.c: sync with netlib/fp/dtoa.c (fixing a glitch unlikely
to affect solver interfaces, but with update to asldate.c).

20090422
  rops.c, rops2.c:  Complain about inability to compute acosh'(t) for
t == +-1.

20090429
  getstub.[ch]: add extern char *Lic_info_add_ASL, to which solvers can
add arbitrary information (such as a copyright notice) that will appear
with command-line invocation "solver -v" for a suitably written solver.

20090430
  getstub.c:  recognize "--help" as synonym for "-?" and "--version" as
synonym for "-v".

20090904
  makefile.u: tweak for use with parallel make invocations (which are
not useful for making amplsolver.a, but might occur in a context of
which the solver interface library is only a part).  No change to
asldate.c.

20091209
  repwhere.c: set errno = 0 at the end (in case it was set by fopen).
  stdio1.h0: add two #undefs to silence MacOSX warnings.
  xectim.c: assume -DNO_RUSAGE when _WIN32 is #defined (for MinGW,e.g.).
  makefile.vc: remove special rule for xectim.obj (no longer needed).

20091215
  xectim.c: tweak for an older version of Microsoft Visual C++;
asldate.c not changed.

20091229
  Various files:  add variant optypeb of optype; optypeb treats OPCPOW
as binary.  This fixes a bug with qp_read supplying nonlinear ops when
the problem is not quadratic (which, e.g., affects snopt when all
constraints are linear).
  Fix a couple of obscure bugs in fgh_read(...) (which should be of
little interest; pfgh_read(...) is recommended instead).

20100111
  dtoa.c:  two obscure bug fixes (see /netlib/fp/changes); the changes
are not relevant for normal solver use, but asldate.c is updated
nonetheless.

20100123
  Fix glitch with printf's handling of negative numbers with %a or %A.
The sign was ignored that the exponent was wrong.
  dtoa.c: more obscure bug fixes (see /netlib/fp/changes) only relevant
to absurdly long input strings to strtod().

20100130
  dtoa.c: more obscure bug fixes (see /netlib/fp/changes) only relevant
to absurdly long input strings to strtod().

20100707
  dtoa.c: an obscure bug fix (see /netlib/fp/changes) that does not
affect amplsolver.a; asldate.c not changed.

20100915
  dtoa.c:  change invisible to ASL (see /netlib/fp/changes); asldate
not changed.

20101105
  avltree.[ch]: tweaks to AVL_visit to permit interrupting a tree walk.
  dtoa.c, dtoa1.c: fix a bug that does not affect solvers (but does
matter to other uses):  strings of more than 40 significant digits
were occasionally converted incorrectly when the first significant
digit appeared after the decimal point.

20101129
  configurehere: tweak for MacOSX: supply -D_NONSTD_SOURCE only if
needed.  (It is needed under MacOSX 10.5, but not Snow Leopard, which
also claims to be MacOSX 10.5.)

20101220
  README.f77:  add details for gfortran.

20110127
  arithchk.c, fpinitmt.c, stderr.c: tweaks for MinGW64; asldate.c
not changed.

20110304:
  dtoa.c: add option of compiling with -DROUND_BIASED_without_Round_Up,
which is not appropriate for the solver-interface library; asldate.c
not changed.

20110308
  stderr.c: under MS Windows, try to cope with a failure of
_open_osfhandle(...) by setting Stderr to fopen("con","w").  This may
be relevant in a shared library (.dll).

20110321
  xsum0.out updated to reflect a modified comment in dtoa.c; asldate.c
not unchanged.

20110410
  configurehere: add a "2>/dev/null" to silense a spurious message on
some versions of Solaris; asldate.c not changed.

20110428
  xsum0.out updated to reflect a modified comment in dtoa.c; asldate.c
not unchanged.

20110620
  configurehere: fix a misplaced backquote in the change of 20110410;
asldate.c not changed.

20110708
  fg_read.c, fgh_rad.c, pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix a bug in handling
complementarity constraints of the form
	const + lin complements L <= expr <= U
in which "const" is a nonzero numeric constant and "lin" is a linear
expression.  The const value was lost by pfgh_read().  The bug only
bit when the flags argument to the .nl reader did not have the
ASL_no_linear_cc_rhs_adjust bit set.
  asl.h: adjust comment about niv.

20110809
  suf_sos.c:  fix a bug in counting nonzeros when an explicit SOS set
(given by .sosno and .ref) has too few members:  only 1 for an SOS1
set, at most 2 for an SOS2 set.
  avltree.[ch], avldelete.c: avldelete.c folded into avltree.c and
withdrawn; new functionality added.  See avltree.h for deatils.
  Many files: KR_header stuff omitted from most files.  New enum
values that can be "or-ed" into flags argument to .nl readers:
ASL_cc_simplify (for simplifying complementarity conditions for
impoverished solvers that only want to see complementarities of the
form var1 >= 0 complements var2 >= 0), ASL_obj_replace_ineq and
ASL_obj_replace_eq (to replace an objective that is a linear
expression in one variable with the body of a constraint in which the
variable appears linearly and nowhere else), ASL_rowwise_jac (to
request row-wise rather than column-wise storage of Jacobians),
ASL_want_A_vals (to cause A_vals to be allocated), and
ASL_sep_U_arrays (to request allocation and use of Uvx and Urhsx).
See comments in asl.h about the new enum values.  The entire interface
library and anything using its headers must be recompiled.
  New files mpec_adj.c, mpec_adj0.c, obj_adj.c obj_adj0.c.  When
ASL_cc_simplify is not used, linking with mpec_adj0.o will give a
slightly smaller program, and when neither ASL_obj_replace_ineq nor
ASL_obj_replace_eq is used, linking with mpec_adj0.o will give s
slightly smaller program.

20110811
  conscale.c:  fix a sign error in adjusting bounds for s < 0 in
varscale(i, s, nerror) and conscale(i, s, nerror).
  writesol.c:  fix a bug in the scaling of returned dual variables
after a call on conscale(i, s, nerror) or lagscale(s, ierror) with
s < 0.

20110814
  asl.h getstub.h sos_add.c: omit recently added "const" in a few places
to avoid trouble with badly written solver interfaces.  Sensible interfaces
use static tables, for which the added "const" keywords eliminated some
compiler warnings.  No change to asldate.c, which remains at 20110811.

20110822
  pfg_read.c, pfghread.c:  fix a rarely-seen fault.
  conscale.c: fix a glitch in Inftest().

20110824
  nqpcheck.c: fix faults introduced 20110809 in, e.g., quadratically
constrained problems as handled by cplex and xpress.

20110826
  suf_sos.c: fix a glitch (possible fault) introduced 20110809 while
trying to eliminate a spurious compiler warning.

20110913
  asl.h:  change Sizeof(x) from (fint)sizeof(x) to simply sizeof(x).
The old definition was once useful on small machine; recently it caused
trouble on a very large problem.
  New source file indic_cons.c (with updates to asl.h, makefile.*,
xsum0.out), to make some code for extracting indicator constraints
generally available that was previously only used in the cplex driver
(which is being updated to use the new indicator_constrs_ASL()
function).

20110916
  Allow function evaluations whose derivatives cannot be evaluated
to succeed, deferring error reporting until the associated
derivatives are requested.  For, say, x^1.2 at 0, whose first but
not second derivative can be computed, with pfgh_read(), the
gradient evaluation will complain, as the Hessian evaluators operate
on cached partial derivative values and do not (currently) provide
for an error return.  Compiling repwhere.c with -DASL_OLD_DERIV_CHECK
restores the old behavior; alternatively, assigning
asl->p.want_derivs_ = 2 before the desired evaluations restores the
old error handling, and assigning asl->p.want_derivs_ = 1 gives the
new error handling.  Compiling misc.c with -DASL_OLD_DERIV_CHECK
changes the default asl->p.want_derivs_ from 1 to 2.
  Add "#ifdef WANT_INFNAN" logic to rops2.c.  (It was already in
rops.c.)  Compiling rops.c and rops2.c with -DWANT_INFNAN will cause
them to return Infinities or NaNs in some cases where they would
otherwise report evaluation errors.
  Catch some Hessian errors (by default) in some corner cases of x^y,
e.g., for x^1.2 at x == 0, for which incorrect values were previously
supplied.

20110927
  suf_sos.c:  fix a fault introduced 20110809 when Cgrad == 0.
  repwhere.c: tweak to avoid a compiler error with archaic compilers.

20110928
  suf_sos.c: fix an off-by-one bug (introduced 20110809) that could
cause a fault.

20111003
  indic_cons.c:  allow double inequalities (and sequences of
constraints separated by && or given by a forall{...} construct) in
indicator constraints.

20111005
  writesol.c:  allocate a scratch array in a couple of previously
missed cases where needed in conjunction with flags ASL_obj_replace_eq
and ASL_obj_replace_ineq to the .nl reader.

20111011
  xectim.c:  on MS Windows systems, have xectim_() return the sum of
times in all threads, just as it does on on Unix-like (Posix) systems.

20111014
  htcl.c:  fix a glitch that only matters when MULTIPLE_THREADS is
#defined:  change NEW_MBLK_LOCK to MBLK_LOCK.
  conscale.c:  fix a mistake in the changes of 20110811 affecting
infinite bounds with negative scalings.

20111018
  mpec_adj.c:  adjust zerograds to reflect the number of variables
after problem adjustments (to prevent out-of-bounds array references
when zeroing gradient components of unused variables).  This only
matters on problems with complementarity constraints when the .nl
reader has ASL_cc_simplify set in its flags argument.
  sphes.c: after sphsetup(-1,1,1,uptri), allow sphes(h,-1,ow,y)
with ow == 0 or y == 0 (or both, giving all zeros in h).
