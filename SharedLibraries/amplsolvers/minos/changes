Fri Jan  8 13:28:04 EST 1993
  Tweak to invoke edagread rather than edag_read.
  Omit unreferenced treerd_().

Wed Feb 10 14:28:54 EST 1993
  Change time stamp to reflect updates in parent (solvers) directory.

Wed Feb 17 02:36:32 EST 1993
  Fix memory fault introduced last week (in reading some nonlinear
problems).

Wed Jun 16 14:51:20 EDT 1993
  Change long to fint, which, if un#defined, is #defined long
(for 8-byte long, e.g. DEC Alpha).

Fri Jun 18 14:07:47 EDT 1993
  Tweak comments in makefile and $S/makefile.

Wed Jun 30 23:29:12 EDT 1993
  Report ignoring integrality of nonlinear integer variables.

Thu Jul  8 19:26:38 EDT 1993
  Distinguish "too many iterations" from "too many major iterations".

Thu Sep  2 07:51:06 EDT 1993
  Update m54ver.c to reflect bug fix to solvers/rops.c (derivative
of constant ** (variable expression)).

Wed Sep  8 14:45:16 EDT 1993
  Update m54ver.c to reflect bug fix to solvers/rops.c (derivative
of atan2(x,y) when y == 0).

Thu Jan 13 11:09:17 EST 1994
  Fix memory fault in stand-alone invocations of minos (reading
a SPECS and MPS file on stdin) when $minos_option is set or
options are given on the command line.

Mon Jan 24 13:03:04 EST 1994
  Fix botch (undefined minos_keywords) introduced 13 Jan. 1994 that
only affects linking against minos.a when m54.o is not also linked
(i.e., non-AMPL uses).

Fri Apr 29 18:17:42 EDT 1994
  For nonlinear problems, change return message "infeasible problem"
to "infeasible problem (or bad starting guess)".

Sat May 14 13:45:09 EDT 1994
  Allow spaces around '=' in $minos_options (and in quoted
command-line options).  Note: there was a bug fix 11 May 1994
to solvers/edagread.c that affects minos in unusual circumstances;
see "changes from ampl/solvers".

Sat Jul  2 21:48:13 EDT 1994
  Fix glitch in funcon.c (apparently introduced June 1993 but not
propagated to minos binaries we've distributed) that could cause
the objective name not to be shown in error messages (that the
nonlinear objective could not be evaluated).

Sat Sep 10 22:22:30 EDT 1994
  Change version to 19940910 to reflect bug fixes to
ampl/solvers/edagread.c.

Thu Oct 13 12:34:11 EDT 1994
  Adjust makefile's xsum.out rule for unnanounced src/README.0
introduced 30 Sept. 1994.

Wed Mar 22 15:05:39 EST 1995
  makefile: fix botch (wrong makefile copied to netlib) of 13 Oct. 1994.

Wed May 17 15:17:20 EDT 1995
  Adjust m54ver.c to reflect fixing a bug in edagread.c that caused
wrong derivatives to be computed in problems involving defined variables
with right-hand sides of the form
	another_defined_variable + linear_expression

Mon Apr 21 23:01:24 EDT 1997
  Update for revised amplsolver.a and "Hooking Your Solver to AMPL".

Sat Jul 12 01:44:38 EDT 1997
  Modify solution message to report numbers of nonlinear evaluations
(when positive).

Tue Dec  2 23:01:45 EST 1997
  m55.c: correct type of variable "timing" (a fix invisible on most
systems).

Thu Mar 26 17:55:12 EST 1998
  m55.c: update to suport AMPL's new facilities for constraint and
variable statuses and solver return codes.

Mon Mar 30 17:16:08 EST 1998
  Simplify makefile to use new facilities in amplsolver.a for importing
user-defined functions.  Cosmetic tweak to m55.c.

Fri Jun  5 15:01:51 EDT 1998
  Adjust returned status values so nonbasic slacks for equality
constraints will have .status value "equ".

Tue Jul 28 22:31:40 EDT 1998
  README.minos: add table of possible solve_result_num values.

Wed Oct 14 00:37:59 EDT 1998
  m55.c: updated to fix a bug with problems having a nonlinear
objective and some purely linear constraint variables that do not
appear in the objective.  Too much of the gradient was zeroed in
this case, possibly corrupting memory.  The fix involves an update of
the AMPL/solver interface library (amplsolver.a or amplsolv.lib), which
must be recompiled.

Thu Oct 15 07:54:37 EDT 1998
  m55.c: trivial changes for Purify users: free memory at end.

Tue Dec 29 14:07:33 EST 1998
  xsum0.out: update to reflect a change on 19 Nov. 1998 to src/xectim.c
(see ../changes).

Wed Jun 16 23:05:52 EDT 1999
  Minor housecleaning, preparing for possible alternative makefiles:
rename makefile makefile.u (for Unix version).

Thu Feb  3 22:54:07 EST 2000
  PC makefile variants added.

Tue Feb 27 17:12:29 EST 2001
  m55.c, m55ver.c0:  adjust so non-student versions of minos will again
work with invocations of the form "minos <specfile 4=foo.mps".  Changes
a while ago broke this archaic invocation form.

Tue Apr 30 18:32:07 EDT 2002
  m55.c: minor tweaks:  recognize -f command-line option (to list
available imported functions), and handle "version" via Ver_val.

Tue May  7 16:38:23 EDT 2002
  makefile.*, m55.c: omit m55ver.c0, which is now automatically
incorporated into m55.c and the solver interface library.

Thu May  9 16:53:28 EDT 2002
makefile.vc: delete the (unwanted) minos.lib and minos.exp files
after making minos.exe.

Wed Jan 24 23:16:17 MST 2007
Update to MINOS 5.51.  The old src directory is gone.

Tue Feb 12 08:06:08 MST 2008
  configure: correct a comment (omit "and maybe MacOSX").
  m551.c: initialize obj to Infinity and do not report an objective
value if the objective cannot be evaluated at the initial point.
(This variable was previously uninitialized, causing a random
objective value to be reported when the objective could not be
evaluated at the starting point.)

Sun May 18 23:47:15 MDT 2008
  m551.c:  New keyword phrase for $minos_options:
	meminc=f
(with f a positive decimal number, possibly in floating-point
notation) causes f megabytes of extra memory to be giving to MINOS
initially.  More memory will be allocated if necessary, in which case
a message of the form

  Adding  meminc=0.271  to $minos_options might save time.

will appear in the solve_message.
  README.minos: add a couple of URLs.

Mon May 25 20:05:51 MDT 2009
  m551.c: fix an uninitialized variable in an unlikely context:
insufficient memory with timing requested.  (A botch in the timing
report was hitherto possible in this context.)

Wed Sep 23 22:22:22 MDT 2009
  m551.c: tweak for problems with many linear and no nonlinear
constraints, so "superbasics_limit=nnn" will not be ignored.
