Solver lbfgsb minimizes functions subject only to simple-bound
constraints.  It is based on L-BFGS-B, by Ciyou Zhu, Richard Byrd,
Peihuang Lu, and Jorge Nocedal; see

Execute

	lbfgsb -?

for a summary of usage and

	lbfgsb -=

to see keywords that may appear in assignments in $lbfgsb_options
or the lbfgsb command line.

Possible solve_result_num values for lbfgsb:

000	Solved: maxnorm(projected gradient) <= pgtol.
100	Solved? relative function change <= macheps * factr.
101	No objective: nprob was out of range of stub.nl had no objectives.
400	More than maxfun function and gradient evaluations.
401	More than maxit iterations.
500	Probable bug: inconsistency in linesearch routine.
501	Error -- probably a bug.
