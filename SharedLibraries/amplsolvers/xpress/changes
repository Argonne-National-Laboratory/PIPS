  xpress.c, README.1st, README.xpress:  update to version 7.1.

20110325
  xpress.c: omit the "debug" keyword unless compiled with -DRWA_DEBUG .

20110419
  xpress.c: fix a bug with quadratic constraints involving some
variables that only appear linearly.

20110825
  xpress.c: some bug fixes, e.g., in handling quadratic forms,
supplied by David Nielsen.

20110913
  xpress.c: add support for indicator constraints, i.e., logical
constraints of the form
	s.t. foo: b == c ==> constraint1 [else constraint2]
with b a binary variable, c = 0 or 1, and the constraints simple
inequality or equality constraints.  This requires linking with
version >= 20110913 of the AMPL/solver interface library.

20111010
 xpress.c: fix a bug in the update of 20110825.
