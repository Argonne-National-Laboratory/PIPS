  mpec_adj.c:  adjust zerograds to reflect the number of variables
after problem adjustments (to prevent out-of-bounds array references
when zeroing gradient components of unused variables).  This only
matters on problems with complementarity constraints when the .nl
reader has ASL_cc_simplify set in its flags argument.
  sphes.c: after sphsetup(-1,1,1,uptri), allow sphes(h,-1,ow,y)
with ow == 0 or y == 0 (or both, giving all zeros in h).
