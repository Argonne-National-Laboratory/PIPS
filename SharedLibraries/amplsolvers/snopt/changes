Tweak things to reflect changes to SNOPT since 19970318.

Fri Jul 11 02:06:00 EDT 1997
Trivial tweak to snopt.c; bring xsum0.out up to date (it was wrong).

Fri Oct 17 01:17:15 EDT 1997
  Report numbers of nonlinear objective and constraint evaluations
(when positive), and the numbers of gradient (and Jacobian) evaluations.
  Give default 99999999 to the iteration limit "iterations".
  This stuff still pertains to SNOPT 5.1.2; a driver for 5.3 is coming.

Thu Oct 23 21:07:31 EDT 1997
  Update to version 5.3.

Fri Oct 24 11:34:08 EDT 1997
  Fix glitch with "snopt -v", which erroneously mentioned "March 1997".

Thu Oct 30 11:52:40 EST 1997
  Make outlev > 1 work as described by "snopt -?".

Thu Nov  6 09:01:26 EST 1997
  snopt.c: tweak for -DKR_headers; snoptver.c0 not changed.

Fri Nov  7 12:45:25 EST 1997
  snopt.c: fix typo in snopt -=; invoke xknowne (added last night
to amplsolver.a) rather than xknown.

Wed Nov 12 17:01:39 EST 1997
  README makefile: tweak to reflect libamplsnopt.a that can now be
created by the makefile in Philip Gill's snopt.tar.gz.

Fri Nov 14 07:47:44 EST 1997
  snopt.c snoptver.c0: correct calling seq. of funcon and funobj (the
change should be invisible, as it involves arguments that are never
referenced); change MINOS to SNOPT in the output of "snopt -?".

Mon Nov 24 08:45:44 EST 1997
  snopt.c snoptver.c0: supply problem name (based on stub), as it
appears in output generated by outlev >= 2.

Tue Feb  3 13:28:01 EST 1998
  snopt.c snoptver.c0: recognize return (not documented in the SNOPT
source) for "Primal feasible solution; could not satisfy dual
feasibility".

Sun Apr 19 21:40:42 EDT 1998
  makefile: omit $S/funcadd0.o; on most systems, $S/amplsolver.a now
provides a recommended default funcadd: see ampl/solvers/funclink/README
for details.

Tue May 26 23:11:20 EDT 1998
  Update to SNOPT 5.3-2.

Fri Jun  5 15:04:15 EDT 1998
  Adjust returned status values so nonbasic slacks for equality
constraints will have .status value "equ".

Tue Jul 28 22:36:04 EDT 1998
  README: add table of possible solve_result_num values.

Wed Oct 14 00:31:19 EDT 1998
  snopt.c: updated to fix a bug with problems having a nonlinear
objective and some purely linear constraint variables that do not
appear in the objective.  Too much of the gradient was zeroed in
this case, possibly corrupting memory.  The fix involves an update of
the AMPL/solver interface library (amplsolver.a or amplsolv.lib), which
must be recompiled.

Thu Nov 19 16:07:42 EST 1998
  snopt.c: correct an off-by-one bug in the numbers of objective and
constraint evaluations reported in the solution message: the numbers
were high by one.
  snoptver.c0: reflect version 5.3-4.

Mon Nov 23 15:18:58 EST 1998
  snopt.c: change default superbasics_limit (which must be known too
soon for the usual default computation by the SNOPT routines) to
min(500, nnL+1), where nnL is the number of nonlinear variables.
  makefile: pout out CFLAGS comments in $S/makefile.

Tue Nov 24 17:21:22 EST 1998
  snopt.c: call snMem() rather than s8Mem() to get memory estimates.
This changes should be invisible, but makes the code a bit simpler and
more readable.

Sat Feb 26 15:25:26 EST 2000
  snopt.c: remove assignment "Plinfy = Infinity" to keep SNOPT's
scaling routine from generating NaNs (under rare conditions).

Mon Feb 28 13:22:45 EST 2000
  snopt.c: recant yesterday's change; something else was amiss in the
example that led to the change.

Thu May 11 12:58:46 EDT 2000
  snopt.c: zero memory passed to sninit_().

Wed May 23 13:38:49 EDT 2001
  snopt.c: Adjust so outlev=n for n > 1 will report SNOPT's function
evaluation times by default (unless timing_=0 is specified).  On some
systems, these times are less accurate than those produced when
ftimes=1 is specified.
  snopt.c:  updated for version 6.1-1; the previous snopt.c (for
version 5.3.5) is now snopt535.c.
  README updated.
  makefile renamed makefile.u; new makefile.vc and subdirectory src
(with its own Unix and Microsoft makefile variants).

Wed Jun 20 16:52:59 EDT 2001
  Minor tweaks... snopt.c: fix glitch on line 942 (change = to ==) and
add #ifdef Finite_Plinfy for machines with buggy Infinity arithmetic.
  Add src/makefile.fu.
  Add student snopt binaries to subdirectories of /ampl/student.

Wed Apr 10 14:02:46 EDT 2002
  snopt.c: upon SIGINT (which may be caused on some systems by typing
control-C or Del), return with solve_result_num = 401 and give
solve_message "SIGINT treated as iteration limit".

Tue Apr 30 18:35:10 EDT 2002
  snopt.c: show less version information by default:  rather than,
"SNOPT 6.1-1(4)(Jun 2001):", print just "SNOPT 6.1-1:".  More detail
is still available with the command-line invocation "snopt -v" or
with "version=1" in $snopt_options.

Mon Oct 22 01:20:56 MDT 2007
  Update to SNOPT version 7.2-5.  Add simple configure and
configurehere scripts.

Thu Nov 29 02:06:53 MST 2007
  snopt.c, README: when the objective cannot be evaluated initially,
report this (with new solve_result_num value 515) rather than that
the constraints cannot be evaluated at the starting point.
  snopt_.c: update for SNOPT 7.*.

Sun Apr  6 22:26:59 MDT 2008
  snopt.c: adjust get_Title to ensure Oinfo.version is null-terminated.

Wed Jun  1 13:17:17 MDT 2011
   snopt.c:  fix an (apparently so-far harmless) out-of-bounds array reference
on QP problems.
