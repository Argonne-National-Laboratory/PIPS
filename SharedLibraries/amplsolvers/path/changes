  path.c updated to reflect changes in PATH header files.

Mon Mar 30 16:47:49 EST 1998
  path.c: updated to return solve_result_num to AMPL.
  version.c changed to version.c0; the makefile now has a rule for
constructing version.c from version.c0 (supplying machine details).

  README: add table of possible solve_result_num values.

Fri Apr 23 15:08:08 EDT 1999
  path.c, version.c0: update for PATH 4.0; the version number (e.g.,
4.0) now comes from PATH's Path_Version() function).

Tue Mar 28 16:57:42 EST 2000
  path.c: remove an unnecessary restriction on matching equations to
variables.  (To come: better matching.)  Now the simple example
	var x{1..3} := 1 >= -3 <= 7;
	s.t. c{i in 1..3}: sum{j in 1..i} x[j]^2 == 2*i;
solves easily.

Thu Apr 13 21:39:21 EDT 2000
  path.c: update for PATH 4.4; better handling of range constraints
(-Infinity < L <= f(x) <= U < Infinity with L < U) and variables with
analogous bounds.  For now, at least, path40.c is a variant of path.c
for PATH 4.0.

  New keywords for $path_options:

	sideineq    handling of side inequalities:
			0 = no warning
			1 = warn (default)
			2 = quit, permitting AMPL loops to test solve_result
			3 = quit, terminating AMPL loops and scripts
			4 = do not make Jacobian nonsingular (avoid
			    nonuniqueness)
			5 = warn and do not make Jacobian nonsingular

	sqwarn      whether to warn of nonsquare systems:
			0 = no
			1 = yes (default)
			2 = quit, permitting AMPL loops to test solve_result
			3 = quit, terminating AMPL loops and scripts

   Change the value of solve_result for "inconsistent bounds"
from "failure" to "infeasible", and change the corresponding
value of solve_result_num from 502 to 200.
   Recognize some new return codes from PATH: here are the new
solve_result_num values:

	201     Infeasible
	403     User interrupt (such as control-C)
	500     Bug -- unexpected return code from PATH
	504     Nonsquare system (when "sqwarn" requires square)
	505     Problem has side inequalities (when "sideineq" allows none)
  Under compilation with -DNEOS, omit keywords "logfile", "optfile", and
"statusfile".  Permit specifying default values for these files with
-DLOGFILE='"logfile_name"', -DSTATUSFILE='"statusfile_name"', and
-DOPTFILE='"optfile_name"'.
  Some modifications for PATH 4.4a and two array-allocation corrections
provided by Todd Munson.

20020503
  Omit version.c0; adjust path.c and makefile.* accordingly.

20050625
  Pass (new flags bit) ASL_no_linear_cc_rhs_adjust to fg_read.
