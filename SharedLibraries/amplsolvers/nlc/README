This directory (solvers/nlc) has source for a program, nlc, that
converts a .nl file (written by "ampl -obstub ...", "ampl -ogstub ...",
or AMPL's "write bstub;" or "write gstub;" commands) to C or Fortran
(on stdout).  Invoke

	nlc '-?'

for a summary of nlc's usage.

File nlcmisc.c is source for some auxiliary routines on which the
resulting C or Fortran may rely.  For more discussion of nlc, see
"Hooking Your Solver to AMPL", which you can download in several forms
from http://www.ampl.com/hooking.html .

For machines with 64-bit pointers, specify -DX64_bit_pointers
in $CFLAGS.

Example input, output, and usage files:

	File		Remarks

	ch3.amp		AMPL version of Chebyquad 3 problem, both as
			least-squares and as minimization problem.

	ch3.nl		From "ampl -ogch3 ch3.amp".

	ch3.c		From "nlc ch3 >ch3.c".

	ch3.kc		From "nlc -k ch3 >ch3.kc".

	ch3.f		From "nlc -f ch3 >ch3.f".

	mngnlc.c	Variant of solvers/examples/mng.c that uses ch3.c
			or (with f2c conventions) ch3.f; for use with

				make mngnlc

	ch3mng.out	From "mngnlc >ch3mng.out".

	nl2nlc.c	Variant of solvers/examples/nl2.c that uses ch3.c
			or (with f2c conventions) ch3.f; for use with

				make nl2nlc

	ch3nl2.out	From "nl2nlc >ch3nl2.out".
