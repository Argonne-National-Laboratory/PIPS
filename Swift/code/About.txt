= PIPS/Swift Development Manual

== Files

=== Application

+rounding-simple.swift+:: 
The Swift/T application script

+run-rounding-simple.sh+:: 
Short script to compile and run the application

=== PIPS Bindings

+swiftpips.h+:: 
C++ function headers to be called from Swift/T

+swiftpips.i+:: 
SWIG interface file: enables C++ to Tcl bindings.
Simply uses +swiftpips.h+

+swiftpips.cpp+:: 
C++ application code.  Can call into PIPS from here

+swiftpips.tcl+:: 
Swift/T dataflow wrappers: wraps calls to PIPS code with Swift/T 
dataflow logic and data access operations

+pips.swift+:: 
Swift/T leaf function header: makes functions in +swiftpips.h+
available in Swift/T

=== Products

Important files created by the build process

+*_wrap.cxx+:: 
Tcl extensions to call C++ functions: generated by SWIG

+*.tcl+:: 
Application Swift/T scripts compiled by +stc+ are represented by Tcl 
scripts  

=== Maintenance

To make an additional PIPS function available in Swift/T: 

1. If necessary, add a wrapper for it in +swiftpips.cpp+
2. Add the function (or wrapper) to +swiftpips.h+
3. Add the dataflow logic in +swiftpips.tcl+ (consult with Wozniak)
4. Add the Swift/T declaration in +pips.swift+

== Configuration
