At our meeting (Wozniak, Lubin, FORGOT LAST NAME) we sketched notes of the
initial algorithm

Photos from the whiteboard are in notes/2012-06-11-*.jpg

Wozniak converted the photos into three Swift scripts:

loops-simple.swift: Simplest implementation.  Should work with
existing Swift/T implementation.

loops-io.swift: As above, but separates I/O from compute function.

loops-update.swift: As above with proposed updateable blob feature.

loops-realtime.swift: As above with proposed timeout feature and
data-aware scheduling feature.
